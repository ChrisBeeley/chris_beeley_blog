title: Analysis tools for Manager Joe
---

I’m using someone else’s data today. It’s absolutely hideously laid out. I could munge it into R but it would take absolutely ages and I’m just not doing enough with it for that to be worth doing.

So I need to have a look at about 30 survey questions using the tools available to the Average Manager Joe- a spreadsheet and the “graph” button.

It’s a real eye opener. Everything takes ages, for one thing, and everything is so janky that I’m not even really sure if I’m drawing the right conclusion. I think the most worrying thing is that the effort involved is so high that I’m losing my curiosity- I’m just trying to get it done. I’m just churning out all this rubbish, giving it a quick eyeball and crashing on.

Why does that seem so familiar? Oh yes, that’s what I’ve always assumed people have done when I read their reports. It’s a big problem, we all know it is, data is too difficult to make sense of, so people do it quickly, and wrongly. We all know this. But I’m living it right now. And I have renewed purpose to make all MY data applications beautifully easy to use. Stay tuned…

I’ve come back to this post. It’s no good. I can’t do it. I’m munging the data into R, even if it will take a little while. It just goes to show, it’s really hard to get away with not doing it properly.
