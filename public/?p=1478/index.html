Well, I suppose to be fair I did do <a href="https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/team-blog/posts/2021-01-20-a-new-github-release-and-future-projects/">a post on our team blog</a> but that feels like I’m making excuses.</p>
<p>Anyway, never mind! This is a quick blog post because this problem I had the other day has, as far as I can tell, absolutely no Google juice at all and it stumped me for ages, even though it is very simple.</p>
<p>We wanted to <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/650">access the height of a Shiny plot at runtime</a> but we couldn’t get it to work in a Shiny module. I googled all sorts of stuff, “session$clientData module”, “accessing plot characteristics shiny module”, “session variable shiny module”, all kinds of things, but it just didn’t work. I figured the namespacing was probably messing it up but I couldn’t figure it out. The simple version would have been session$clientData$output_sentiment_plot_upset_width, but I wasn’t surprised that that didn’t work because of the namespacing.</p>
<p>When I looked at the raw HTML (which I did, in desperation) I saw that the input was actually called “output_mod_sentiment_ui_1-sentiment_plot_upset”. The mod_sentiment bit is the name spacing. So I got pretty close when I tried session$clientData$output_mod_sentiment_ui_1-sentiment_plot_upset_width. But R thought that the hyphen was a minus, so that didn’t work either. Then the light dawned</p>
