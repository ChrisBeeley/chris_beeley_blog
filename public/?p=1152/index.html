<p>I’m sure the analysis is well intentioned and basically correct, so I didn’t really have any problem with it, but my arm shot up anyway, because I wanted to see more details of the analysis. The results were so good, I was just curious to see how they were so good really- what were the 95% confidence intervals, the sample sizes, alpha levels, just the nitty gritty of the analysis so I could really get all the detail of it.</p>
<p>But they didn’t have it. They didn’t have much on the slides, and they hadn’t brought any supplementary materials.</p>
<p>I don’t have a problem with that either. I think probably the reason why they didn’t is they don’t usually have stats wonks sitting at the back asking awkward questions. So they didn’t feel the need to be prepared.</p>
<p>I cut my teeth (whille doing my PhD) at academic conferences. Asking awkward questions about statistical analyses is a spectator sport there. And I love it. Everyone’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats">black hat</a>, just waiting to crawl inside your work and blow it apart. It’s like a duel, like a competition. And of course that’s how science works. Everyone’s desperate to prove you wrong, and if you can stay at the top, then fair play to you. Probably something in it.</p>
<p>There isn’t enough of that where I work, in the NHS. It really reinforced to me the need to keep going with what I’m doing. I want to train, face to face, everyone in my whole organisation who works with data. Two hours or fifteen, I want to equip them to ask awkward questions.</p>
<p>And one day, I want to sit at the back of the room with my arms folded and watch a whole roomful of arms shoot up.</p>
<p>THEN I can relax.</p>
