    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Well, I said I was going to blog at least one thing I learned at the conference each day, today I’ve learned about 50 million things (yesterday was tutorials so I learned two things well; seen 20 presentations today, posters later).</p>
<p>To be honest I think this post is going to be more use to me in remembering everything than it will be to anyone else, but I’ll try to do it properly.</p>
<p>I learned about the <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/MASS/html/stepAIC.html"> StepAIC</a> function, which is evidently some sort of stepwise regression which uses the AIC criterion. Someone mentioned it in passing but it sounds pretty useful. I also learned about Box-Cox plots (this is probably really embarrassing that I don’t know this, my PhD was psychology, I’m afraid I’ve learned a lot about stats after the fact, just getting the research and the thesis done was enough really in four years); they also sound pretty cool and useful.</p>
<p>I learned about Mosaic plots, the structable command, and relative multiple barcharts (which, from memory, are in the extracat package). If you don’t know these are useful for looking at 3-way and higher cross-tabs type tables. Looks pretty cool.</p>
<p>I learned about running R in the cloud all sorts of ways, the most interesting sounded like using <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RGoogleDocs/"> RGoogleDocs</a> and Apache and I wonder if I could get this working at work, will investigate further.</p>
<p>And last but not least I learned yet another way of automating the patient survey, this time using the <a href="http://orgmode.org/"> Org mode</a> of EMacs. So far I have encountered quite a bewildering array of different ways of achieving the same task:</p>
<p>1) Sweave<br>
2) odfWeave<br>
3) Sweave and brew (this is what I have used so far)<br>
4) Org mode<br>
5) R2wd</p>
<p>Each has various advantages, disadvantages, OS issues, etc. etc. etc. The code I’ve written is hugely long and complex and just generally awful. I’ll put a link to it here so I can confess my <a href="http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf"> sins</a>. I wrote it in one quarterly reporting cycle in a “make it work quickly” type way and it will definitely be more reliable and easier to develop if I re-write it properly this quarter.</p>
<p>The commenting of the code is also awful, I’m not going to go through and comment loads of dreadful code just for the blog, but I will sort that out in V 2.0 as well. Note also that they wanted an editable document, so I wrote the whole thing in Sweave, then converted the pdf to Word, which looked dreadful, and then rapidly re-wrote the whole thing to play nicely with <a href="http://latex2rtf.sourceforge.net/"> LaTeX2rtf</a>, which was incredibly useful.</p>
<p>The whole thing was <!-- raw HTML omitted --> brew<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-ed, then compiled to LaTeX. The graphics were done separately, as you can see. I think I’ll bring them in next time because that seems simpler somehow.</p>
<p>It’s very ugly but it did work. In future posts I’ll show how I’ve improved it and perhaps redeem myself a little bit.</p>
