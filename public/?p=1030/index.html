As I think I mentioned I’ve been rather ill for the last couple of years and I’m afraid I kind of fell out of touch with things a bit. Anyway, I’m all better now and I’m going to be giving a talk at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NottinghamR-Nottingham-R-Users-Group/">R User Group in Nottingham</a> (which I love profoundly) so I thought I’d do it this new sexy way.</p>
<p>It seems pretty handy, haven’t made the whole presentation yet so I’m sure there’s more to come but the first thing is, dang! The code in an echo = TRUE chunk is really large! I can’t fit any output on the page!</p>
<p>So I found <a href="https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/27777_55697c3a476640caa0ad2099fe914ae5.html#/">this guide to making it smaller</a>, and lots of other nice tweaks, too.</p>
