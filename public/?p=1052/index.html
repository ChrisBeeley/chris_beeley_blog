        <p>So my favourite productivity guru, David Allen, he of <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a> fame, has a suggestion for a New Year review that you should carry out each year. His <a href="https://www.improvisedlife.com/2012/01/09/david-allens-potent-questions-for-a-new-year/">suggested structure</a> can be found here.</p>
<p>I think this is an excellent idea so I have set myself a recurring reminder to do it each year, starting now. And I may as well blog it so I can find it again and anyone else who’s interested can have a read and maybe be inspired to do their own.</p>
<p>I had a bit of a rough year in 2017 and required surgery to remove my colon and spleen after a long battle with ulcerative colitis, so the 2017 bit is going to be a bit shorter than it will be next year. Still, I did achieve some stuff so let’s have a look.</p>
<p>The most sort of visible thing I did this year was make some videos about Shiny. There are two courses, and they’re available to buy (or you can watch them with a subscription) at the links <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/getting-started-shiny-video">Getting Started with Shiny</a> and <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/ui-development-shiny-video">UI Development with Shiny</a>. There are some angry people on Amazon reviewing my book who clearly wanted it to have more advanced applications in so I’ll warn you here they don’t feature any highly complex applications. They’re more for people who are starting out. I have another one coming out soon called Advanced Shiny, I can’t link to it yet because it doesn’t exist. Again that’s sort of moderately advanced- interacting with databases, JavaScript, adding a password, stuff like that. So don’t buy them or subscribe to the video service hoping for some real high level stuff, because it’s not in there. I’d hate for you to feel like you wasted your money.</p>
<p>Anyway, I also started doing a lot of work with Shiny at work, it’s taking off in a big way, and when I talk about 2018 I’ll be saying that I’ve got big plans at work, my role is developing quite a lot based on what we’ve achieved already in 2017. I’ve also learned quite a lot of stuff about text analytics, with the hope of relaunching a Shiny application I wrote a few years back and currently maintain with a lot of tools in it to allow the user to explore text based data. I’ll say more about that next year when I’ve actually done it.</p>
<p>I also learned how to implement an API in PHP, which is pretty easy really when you know how but it was cool to learn anyway.</p>
<p>I was in the right place at the right time, really, at work, in terms of having the experience with Shiny that I do and being able to help with this project that’s developing, so I’ve been quite lucky to be on board but I also give myself some credit for reading the runes and training myself up in Shiny to be ready to help with something like this. The skills I’ve acquired both in Shiny programming and in running Linux servers to run Shiny Server and relevant databases on are suddenly very valuable to my organisation, so I feel I called this one correctly. My next prediction is text analysis, I feel like if I can learn that and do it really well over the next five years then there could be opportunities there.</p>
<p>In terms of my personal life, really it feels like all I did was be very, very ill with severe inflammatory bowel disease and then have surgery to correct it. That consumed a lot of my energy, really. I’ve now recovered and I’m back doing 10 mile runs at the weekend, which is great. I’ve actually very tentatively started writing a book about my experiences being ill, which I’ll talk about more if I actually get anywhere with it next year.</p>
<p>So in 2018 I’ll be developing my role at work, and having much more input more widely across the organisation both in terms of Shiny, live analytics, dashboards and all that stuff, but also in terms of statistics and analysing real datasets from healthcare services, which is where I started out, really, finishing my psychology PhD in 2008 looking at routinely collected data in psychiatric hospitals with mixed effects models. And as I mentioned I’ll be improving one of my Shiny applications, adding a lot of tools to help users explore the text.</p>
<p>In my personal life I want to be a really good dad since my kids got a bit of raw deal with my being sick in 2017 and I’m going to run a marathon in less than four hours. I didn’t run for 3 years or so because of having liver disease and then bowel disease so I really owe it to myself to get a nice marathon PB under my belt (current PB is 4’14”). And I’m going to try to clear the decks a bit and get writing a book about my experiences being ill, a lot of people have told me that they think it would be good so I’m going to have a go.</p>
<p>David Allen has some questions, I missed out the ones for the year just gone because it was such a strange year, but let’s look at some for 2018.</p>
<p>What would you like to be your biggest triumph in 2018?<br>
If I can make this new job role work then I’ll be really pleased because it’s a big important step up for me and I think it will be really valuable to the Trust. And I really want to run a sub 4 marathon. If I can do those two things, I’m happy.</p>
<p>What is the major effort you are planning to improve your financial results in 2018?<br>
I’ve actually got a savings account now, after being hopeless with money in the past. I’m really trying to save up for things instead of impulsively buying them, and with a bit of luck I can treat myself to a beautiful <a href="https://www.entroware.com/store/apollo">Entroware laptop</a> in 2018</p>
<p>What major indulgence are you willing to experience in 2018?<br>
Now the kids are a bit older I’d love to go on a skiing holiday with them. I love snowboarding and haven’t been for ages.</p>
<p>What would you most like to change about yourself in 2018?<br>
Definitely better organised and less forgetful. I’m really trying hard at the moment to put reminders in my phone for everything, work stuff, buying presents, stuff for my kids, everything.</p>
<p>What is one as yet undeveloped talent you are willing to explore in 2018?<br>
I’m really going to have to get big picture mode at work. I’ve had my head down learning the stack for processing patient experience data, but in 2018 I need to work much more widely- with say finance data, or HR, clinical outcomes. I’m really looking forward to getting my teeth into that.</p>
<p>What brings you the most joy and how are you going to do or have more of that in 2018?<br>
Running. Lots and lots and lots of lovely running. I’m making time to do that, already am.</p>
<p>Who or what, other than yourself, are you most committed to loving and serving in 2018?<br>
My kids deserve a really good dad who’s not ill all the time, and that’s exactly what they’re going to get.</p>
<p>What one word would you like to have as your theme in 2018?<br>
Health. Beautiful, glorious, wonderful health.</p>
