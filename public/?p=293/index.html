In order to make sure that my code keeps pace with the interface they design and there’s no nasty surprises when the launch of the website gets near I’ve been doing some prototyping with the wonderful <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/">Shiny</a> package from the amazing people over at RStudio, whose IDE I sincerely love.</p>
<p>I’ve done a little video about it for the challenge which I thought I might as well share on here. I’m blown away by how easy it is to use and although I’m using it for prototyping in this case I can imagine building a whole tool with it and getting something really useful and attractive, maybe with a little bit of JavaScript jiggery-pokery.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/54727705">Video</a></p>
<p>I won’t share all the server side code because it’s a bit of a mess at the moment, I’ll put a cleaner version up on GitHub once it’s a bit further along, but here’s the UI code just to demonstrate how simple it is (really the server side just picks up one or two of the variables and then does various graphs etc. based on code I already had).</p>
