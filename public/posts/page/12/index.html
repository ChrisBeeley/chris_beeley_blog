        <p>A government department in Australia reports saving very large amounts of money by shunning paid for proprietary software and implementing their own version with R (<a href="http://mobile.itnews.com.au/News/390687,what-immigration-did-with-just-1m-and-open-source-software.aspx">link to story</a>).</p>
<p>If you follow the link they have some comments with a person who works at SAS who naturally talks down the benefits of free and open source software such as R (but then they would, wouldn’t they?). They report “He said the true cost of the supposedly free software can actually be quite substantial, when human resources and maintenance of the software is factored in”.</p>

        <p>This is a book review of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780814433683.do">Supercommunicator by Frank J. Pietrucha</a></p>
<p>Full disclosure: I received this book free as part of O’Reilly’s reader review program.</p>
<p>It’s a fact oft-acknowledged that books about communication and especially about grammar fall at the hurdles they themselves set, with books about grammar often containing solecisms and books about communication including leaden or otherwise dreadful prose. Even with this in mind, this is not a good book.</p>

        <p>I made a little Twitter ticker for work the other day, which will fetch posts with a particular hashtag and then animate them marquee style across the screen, I thought I may as well share it here. This version will fetch the last 100 tweets to the #rstats hashtag, remove the retweeets, and then show up to 50 animated across the screen.</p>
<p>All of the Twitter authentication PHP magic is stolen from <a href="http://140dev.com/twitter-api-programming-blog/twitter-api-ebook-single-user-twitter-oauth-programming/">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is a review of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023487.do">Learning PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and CSS, 2nd Edition</a> by Robin Nixon.</p>
<p>As you can tell by the title this is a big book that covers a lot of material. There is a decent treatment of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and CSS within this book. When I came to it I knew nothing about PHP, a little MySQL, a smidgen of JavaScript, and a little bit of CSS and could follow each of the sections without too much difficulty.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>The new version of Shiny (0.9) is wonderful, hopefully I will talk about it again soon, but it does break the code in my book, <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/web-application-development-with-r-using-shiny/book">Web application development with R using Shiny</a>. It’s only a small difference, the selectInput() function used to ask for preselected elements to be given as the name of a list (i.e. the friendly version that appears to users in the UI, “Egg Salad”) whereas now it asks for the actual value (“eggSalad”, e.g.).</p>

        <p>Working in the NHS as I do, which runs all of its IT on Windows, I’d always despaired of being able to get <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/server/">Shiny Server</a> working. However, I went to see the IT department and they have very kindly given me access to a virtual machine with Ubuntu 12.04.04 LTS running on it. It’s completely firewalled from the internet and is only visible from within the network, which is quite useful because it means I can put up things on it which are not for public consumption.</p>

        <p>Today seems as good a day as any to start archiving all the useful R functions I see scattered around the internet.

        <p>When I started using R in about 2009 <a href="http://users.stat.umn.edu/~geyer/Sweave/">reproducible research</a> was a complete eye-opener for me. Statistical analyses should be reproducible both by the author of them and by the scientific community and by embedding the analysis and outputting code within a <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/lp.html">literate programming</a> framework such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweave">Sweave</a> this was possible. Nearly everything I produce now, whether for regular reports on patient experience for the NHS Trust for which I work or for scientific papers is reproducible. These tools have saved me (and therefore my employer) hundreds of hours and they are all totally free.</p>
