      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I work in a small (growing) team of data scientists and we‚Äôre part of a larger analytic unit which has a focus on innovation in analytics (hence us) and public health methods. We have a pretty broad remit to do interesting and useful stuff and we focus on things that we think are useful (for example, applying data science methods to problems relating to equity of access to services) and things that people ask us to help with.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I‚Äôve seen some discussion on the Internet about whether people learning Shiny should start with modules or if they‚Äôre an advanced topic. I‚Äôm not going to link to any examples because this post is definitely not me saying- hey look at this rubbish over here, here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs wrong. I‚Äôve seen a couple of posts talking about it. But I just thought I would chip in my perspective.</p>
<p>I really love modules and they solve a lot of problems, and I think they could be a great thing for a beginner to learn. No reason at all why beginners can‚Äôt learn them. The only caution I would give those learners is that some things can be weird or fiddly with modules. So if you‚Äôre learning at your own pace, and want to do everything really neatly and use industry standards, great, go for it. But if you want to throw up a Shiny application to impress your boss (for example) and learn by doing then you may find yourself going down some very long, dark rabbit holes trying to get the particular thing you want working. (and yes, I am writing this post now because I have been down a few myself recently üòÄ)</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I just recruited to a data science post at Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust and I‚Äôve been asked for feedback by several people about how to get started in data science in healthcare, and indeed how to get a job in data science in healthcare. I will also be recruiting another data scientist for our team in a few months. This post is designed to give you a feel for what we were looking for in the job that I just recruited to, as well as to the job that is coming up. They‚Äôre slightly different skill sets as I will discuss.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>This is part II of what would otherwise have been a far-too-long post about configuring RStudio Connect. A bit of back story, particularly for those of you who might have hit this from a Google search (which does happen, JetPack tells me) and don‚Äôt know who the heck I am and what I do all day. Here‚Äôs what I said in part I:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve been using RStudio stuff on the server for a long time. I started using Shiny community edition back in 2013 for an application that is totally open and so doesn‚Äôt need authenticating. Then two years ago I started deploying Shiny applications that people authenticated to behind our Trust firewall using Shiny Pro. I have wanted to use RStudio Connect for a long time but it was hard to get the funding together for it given how things are with austerity since the banking crisis.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I‚Äôm hopeful we‚Äôre moving into a bit of a new phase with using R in my Trust so I thought I‚Äôd outline the direction of travel, to see if it chimes with anyone else and just to keep people up to date about what we‚Äôre doing.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve used Shiny for some years now, maybe 7, and we have applications behind the firewall and in the cloud which are well used by the staff who need them. We‚Äôve also been building our skills (R and data ops, which is a whole other post) and I‚Äôm hopeful that we‚Äôre ready for the next phase, which I would call the ‚Äúproductionise‚Äù phase. There are two main tasks to achieve before we‚Äôve really got the work that we‚Äôre doing nicely embedded in everyday practice at Nottinghamshire Healthcare.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I‚Äôm doing some Shiny training this year and I want to teach whatever the new thinking is so I‚Äôve been reading Hadley Wickham‚Äôs online book <a href="https://mastering-shiny.org/">Mastering Shiny</a>. There‚Äôs a couple of things that I‚Äôve noticed where Shiny is moving on, so if you want to keep up to date I suggest you have a look. I‚Äôm going to pick out a few here. Firstly, note that in Shiny 1.5 (which is not released at the time of writing) all code in the R/ directory will be sourced automatically. This is a very good idea, I‚Äôve got loads of source(‚Äúuseful_code.R‚Äù, local = TRUE) lines in some of my applications, so it gets rid of all that.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>Someone just emailed me to ask me about getting into data science. They knew all the usual stuff, linear algebra, Python, all that stuff, so I thought I‚Äôd talk about the other side of data science. It‚Äôs all stuff I say whenever I talk about data science, but I‚Äôve never written it down so I thought I may as well blog it.</p>
<p>There are three things that are probably harder to learn that will make you stand out at interview and be a better data scientist.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I‚Äôm writing something about software licensing and IP in NHS data science projects at the moment. I don‚Äôt think I ever dreamed about doing this, but I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of people working in data science and related fields are confused about some of the issues and I would like to produce a set of facts (and opinions) which are based on a thorough reading of the subject and share them with interested parties. It‚Äôs a big job but I thought I‚Äôd trail a bit of it here and there as I go. Here‚Äôs the summary at the end of the licences section.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>As I mentioned on Twitter the other day, I have this rather ugly spreadsheet that comes from some online survey software that requires quite a lot of cleaning in order to upload it to the database. I had an old version written in base R but the survey has changed so I‚Äôve updated it to tidyverse.</p>
<p>And this is where tidyverse absolutely shines. Using it for this job really made me realise how much help it gives you when you‚Äôve got a big mess and you want to rapidly turn it into a proper dataset, renaming, recoding, and generally cleaning.</p>
