      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>One phenomenon that I find very strange in the NHS (and elsewhere, probably, I‚Äôve never worked anywhere else) is the obsession people have with having tables of numbers instead of graphs. I have encountered this absolutely everywhere. People really want to know whether something is 21.4% of the whole or 19.2% of the whole and they can‚Äôt tell by looking at the beautiful graph that you‚Äôve drawn.</p>
<p>I saw an analysis today which had nine separate tables of proportions. I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say no human being can understand a thing of such complexity. Nine tables, each with three categories, 27 proportions given. You could fit the whole thing on one graph and it would be readily apparent how they compare with each other.</p>

<p>So far, so ordinary. What else do we all know? League tables are a bad idea too. Somewhat related to Goodhart‚Äôs law, the problem with league tables is that they often ignore nuance. &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; schools aren‚Äôt bad, they just have an intake that starts way behind. &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; surgeons aren‚Äôt bad, they just take on the more complex cases or work in a geographical location where there are more complex cases. There are ways of trying to balance out this bias, <a href="https://www.tes.com/news/revealed-top-ranked-schools-fairer-league-tables">&ldquo;value added&rdquo;</a> in the case of schools (being married to a teacher, I hear a lot about this one), and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23426886/">case mix adjustment in the case of surgeons</a>. Although these methods go some way to ironing out problems there is always the chance that an unmeasured variable is affecting the results and distorting the picture.</p>

        <p>We‚Äôre systematically devaluing management and leadership in the analyst space, and I encounter a lot of people who think that a day with no code written is a day wasted. I do write code, but I do a lot of other valuable stuff too. I‚Äôve written this post as someone who is very new to managing people with my personal opinion, so just like my posts on proxied SSL with Apache, there is your caveat emptor üôÇ</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve been meaning to write this for ages and I‚Äôve just had a rather silly conversation on Twitter about managers and leaders in the NHS which has inspired me to get on with it. I think most people are agreed that we have A Problem with mangers and leaders in the analytic space. Much ink has been spilled in the subject, and I think that the two main conclusions of all this ink are broadly accepted by everyone. They are, briefly:</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>From a <a href="https://twitter.com/_johnmackintosh/status/1374986918878965760?s=19">tweet from my NHS-R buddy John MacKintosh</a></p>
<p>‚ÄúTwo schools of thought :<br>
1. Do as much as possible using SQL (joins/ munging/ calculations and analysis) so that your analysis is portable between different BI / Viz tools<br>
2. Do the basics (e.g. joins and simple aggregates) in SQL, calcs and analysis in front end tools‚Äù</p>
<p>This is a great question, and I don‚Äôt mean to detract from its greatness when I say it is over simplistic. It‚Äôs an important question, and I have a lot to say on the subject, so much so in fact that I‚Äôm going to answer a tweet with a blog, which is very on brand for me üòÑ.When we think of data scientists and data engineers, we tend to think of data engineers providing beautifully normal and rapid data structures and data scientists wrangling them with a mix of SQL and R/ Python/ whatever. But in my experience it doesn‚Äôt really work cleanly that way, and nor should it.</p>

        <p>We‚Äôre rebuilding our patient experience dashboard at the moment, partly to incorporate some of the work that <a href="https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/positive_about_change_text_mining">we‚Äôre doing on text mining</a> and partly to connect it up to other types of information we have like staff experience and clinical outcomes. It has to be reusable because we‚Äôre using it as the basis of the text mining dashboard that we‚Äôre building for any provider trust to use with their friends and family test data. We‚Äôre trying to make everything reusable anyway partly because the different bits of the NHS should all cooperate and produce stuff together that everyone can use and partly because we‚Äôre realising that when you make code reusable the first person who can reuse it is you, 6 months later on a similar project.<br>
So we have a patient experience dashboard that we want to hook up to our other data in our own context, and we have other trusts who want to take what we produce and hook their stuff in to it. An obvious approach is to use modules in Shiny and have a data module at the heart of the operation, which can take account of the different datasets available in each context. The next level would be a ‚Äúsummary type‚Äù module which would bring together all of the inputs and outputs for a particular type of data- one for patient experience, one for staff experience, etc. And the bottom level would be submodules which would carry out the individual tasks- one module to produce graphical summaries, one to produce downloadable reports, etc. We would use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/golem/index.html">{golem} package</a> for all the reasons that we normally use {golem} (help with dependencies, packaging, testing, and deployment)<br>
The basic structure would look like this:</p>

        <p>It was my New Year‚Äôs resolution to blog more and that‚Äôs going really well because this is the first blog I‚Äôve done all year and it‚Äôs nearly the end of January. Well, I suppose to be fair I did do <a href="https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/team-blog/posts/2021-01-20-a-new-github-release-and-future-projects/">a post on our team blog</a> but that feels like I‚Äôm making excuses.</p>
<p>Anyway, never mind! This is a quick blog post because this problem I had the other day has, as far as I can tell, absolutely no Google juice at all and it stumped me for ages, even though it is very simple.</p>
