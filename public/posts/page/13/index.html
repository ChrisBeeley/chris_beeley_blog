      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>When I started using R in about 2009 <a href="http://users.stat.umn.edu/~geyer/Sweave/">reproducible research</a> was a complete eye-opener for me. Statistical analyses should be reproducible both by the author of them and by the scientific community and by embedding the analysis and outputting code within a <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/lp.html">literate programming</a> framework such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweave">Sweave</a> this was possible. Nearly everything I produce now, whether for regular reports on patient experience for the NHS Trust for which I work or for scientific papers is reproducible. These tools have saved me (and therefore my employer) hundreds of hours and they are all totally free.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>This is another post which is designed both to help me as an aide-memoire and also to help anyone else out there who wants to set up a new Linux install quickly and easily.</p>
<p>One of the many, many things I love about Linux is the way that you can just tear down your OS any time you like and start using a different one. Having said that, I must admit to having had some long weekends and evenings when my installation has gone kaput fiddling around trying to get everything working. I have now streamlined the process and can set up a new Ubuntu-based distribution in probably no more than about 45 minutes. My Linux career has only been from Ubuntu to the Ubuntu-based Mint so far, I have tried to use Fedora but sadly my ridiculously powerful NVidia graphics card left over from my (whisper it) Windoze days does not appear to play nicely at all with Fedora. Going to have a go with Fedora 20 some time, you never know your luck.</p>

        <p>To my great shame, I never published the findings from my PhD (Daily behavioural ratings: what can behavioural observation tell us about psychopathy, personality disorder and violence risk in secure psychiatric settings?) in any journals, by the time I’d finished I was so busy with my new job that I just never got round to it.</p>
<p>The least I can do is host the thesis on my server in case it proves of use to anyone, and I have added it to my <a href="http://chrisbeeley.net/website/">website</a> today, link to file <a href="http://chrisbeeley.net/website/ChrisBeeleyThesis_WithCorrections.pdf">here</a>.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>Book review<br>
Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline By Cathy O’Neil, Rachel Schutt<br>
Publisher: O’Reilly Media</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I received a free electronic copy of this book to review as part of O’Reilly’s Reader Review Program</p>
<p>This book seems to be everywhere at the moment, largely, I imagine, because there’s a gaping hole in the market for such a book. Indeed, there’s a gaping hole in the market, it seems, for everything to do with data science, from books and courses to the actual people themselves. Famously, the world toiled away without even a Wikipedia entry for data science until the relatively recent past.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>As many of you will be aware, the Twittersphere was recently ignited by Lottie Dexter (<a href="http://politicalscrapbook.net/2014/02/tory-boss-of-government-coding-education-initiative-cant-code-lottie-dexter/">Year of code boss can’t code</a>) and her car crash performance on Newsnight. I don’t have much to add to what has already been said apart from to note with sadness yet another typical example of a public servant being involved with technology of which they have no comprehension.</p>
<p>Jeremy Paxman expressed cynicism within the interview regarding the idea that all people need to be able to code, and by extension that all children need to be taught coding. I think this betrays an understanding of what it means to “be able to code”. I would like to illustrate this with a couple of examples.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I gave a talk at the <a href="http://www.londonr.org/">LondonR</a> group last night about using <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/">Shiny</a> and particularly about integrating it with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to go nicely with other web content. Appropriately enough, therefore, I made the whole talk using HTML. Thanks to Romain Francois for his excellent <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/highlight/index.html">highlight</a> package (surely it should be called highlightR, though?) with which I did the HTML for the highlighting of R syntax and to <a href="http://tohtml.com/">this</a> website with which I highlighted the HTML, JavaScript and jQuery.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I recently sent the following to the New Statesman in response to a piece they recently carried which weighed up the likely fortunes of Google, Facebook, and Apple, and asked which would be the internet platform of the future. It is quite obvious to me that we already have the internet platform of the future, and it’s called Linux. They ran it, edited, in the letters page, but they don’t publish letters online so here, for the first time, live and unplugged, is the unexpurgated version.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I just wrote this for the Institute of Mental Health <a href="http://imhblog.wordpress.com/">blog</a> so I thought I may as well cross-post here. I promise I will talk about something other than Shiny soon 🙂</p>
<p>Open source software refers to software whose code is available for anybody to view, revise and reuse. This should be contrasted with closed or proprietary code which is known only to the manufacturer, and who will often charge a fee for individuals to use the software (for example, Microsoft Word, or Adobe Photoshop).</p>
