      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>My book has just come out, <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/web-application-development-with-r-using-shiny/book">Web Application Development with R using Shiny</a>. It’s an introduction to the marvellous <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/">Shiny</a> from the wonderful people at RStudio. Although the online documentation for Shiny does cover most of the things you might want to do with it the people who approached me about writing the book thought that having a more comprehensive guide with some worked examples would be useful. And I was inclined to agree. So I wrote the book in 3 months, which was one of the most brilliant and awful experiences of my entire life.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>As you may or may not be aware, I recently helped on the data side of <a href="http://www.nottinghamshirehealthcare.nhs.uk/">Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust’s</a> feedback website which lives <a href="http://feedback.nottinghamshirehealthcare.nhs.uk/reports/custom">here</a>. Part of this work was collecting the data we receive from the Trust-wide patient survey and bringing it in with other sources of feedback, including stories from our friends over at <a href="https://www.patientopinion.org.uk/">Patient Opinion</a>.</p>
<p>For a long time I’ve queried their data using their API (documentation is <a href="%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.patientopinion.org.uk/info/api-docs%E2%80%9D">here</a>) and fiddled around with it a bit, but my XML was never quite up to doing a proper extract and getting the data into the same structure as the rest of our patient experience data. The job sort of got shelved under “A computer program could do this, nobody has time to write the computer program, maybe a human will do it” which to be honest is quite a large shelf groaning with the weight of a lot of stuff at the moment.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>It’s becoming rather <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/">Shiny</a>-centric, this blog, I know, but I just put some little demos about how to use Shiny with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, just some toy examples with links to source, up on the <a href="http://chrisbeeley.net/website/">website</a>.</p>
<p>So if you’re interested in Shiny go have a look. Each has a link to the interactive version and the source. Do note that there are easier/ better ways of doing some of these things (row highlighting can be done in CSS rather than jQuery, e.g.); these are really just for educational purposes.</p>

        <p>For those of you using the brilliant <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/">Shiny</a> package in R, I’ve built a little toy to help you learn/ remember the main widget types and the type of values they return.

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>One for Linux users forced to use Citrix to log in to their corporate email, such as myself. I’d long given up trying to get Citrix to work on Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop, but a recent success with 13.04 on my main computer led me to have another go. I followed the instructions here <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CitrixICAClientHowTo">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CitrixICAClientHowTo</a>, got some weird error message, followed the instructions here <a href="http://forums.citrix.com/thread.jspa?threadID=306353&amp;tstart=0">http://forums.citrix.com/thread.jspa?threadID=306353&amp;tstart=0</a> and BOOM, I was in.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I’ve had my own server for a little while now, with a very scabby and unattractive webpage on it, some Java I haven’t got round to turning into an applet, a couple of random Shiny apps, and that’s about it.</p>
<p>I’m very busy at the moment writing a book so I’m afraid I haven’t really had time to work on any of these side projects. I have, however, done loads of cool things with the actual server, so I thought I might mention these. Having your own server is like all the best things in life, once you’ve got it you don’t know how you ever got on without it. So, what are all the exciting things that my server does?</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>Sort of apropos of nothing, really, this, but I was doing some research with some colleagues the other day and to help out I built a <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/">shiny</a> application in a morning. Munging the data etc. took ages as it always does but once I actually had everything clean and tidy and working laying an interface on top was the easy bit. What a fantastic tool it really is, completely changed the way we work with data now we can just throw stuff on the internet and let people play around just in the morning. My sincere thanks to all the devs at <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio.</a></p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>Well, it finally launched today, the patient feedback website that we created as part of the <a href="http://www.institute.nhs.uk/innovation/spread_and_adoption/nhs_patient_feedback_challenge.html">Patient Feedback Challenge</a>. The evaluation section was part of a partnership with the <a href="http://www.nottinghamshirehealthcare.nhs.uk/get-involved/involvement-team/">Involvement Centre</a> of Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust and the web design agency <a href="http://numiko.com/">Numiko</a> to build a website which can help us to collect feedback data, summarise and report on it and share the actions and learning which have resulted. Go have a <a href="http://feedback.nottinghamshirehealthcare.nhs.uk/">look</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the philosophy of the feedback challenge was that the good practice should be “spreadable” and the website is all built using free and open source technologies (Linux servers, all data and graphs processed using <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> etc.). We plan to roll it out in as many Trusts as possible and will charge a small sum for redesigns and changes to data processing which will allow us to repurpose it for different Trusts as well as supporting further development of the site.</p>
