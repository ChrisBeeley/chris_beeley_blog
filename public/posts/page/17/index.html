        <p>I’ve been analysing some data and we’re a bit unsure, as we often are, as to its quality. We have a variety of clinicians rating C.tot and R.tot over a four year period for a set of patients. To summarise, there was some concern that people are rating C.tot consistently and well but not so with R.tot (I’m not going to explain the variables or where they come from because it’s not relevant and it’s an internal dataset we’re not ready to share yet).</p>

        <p>I’ve just seen an amazing video, Brett Victor talking about <a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle.</a></p>
<p>It should be of great interest to programmers and creatives and indeed anyone who needs or wants to come up with new and exciting ideas (everyone, in other words). If you’re not a programmer, stick with the video because he broadens out the discussion a lot a third of the way in. And if you are, just get stuck in and watch. You won’t regret it.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I’ve just been looking at the <a href="http://blog.infoadvisors.com/index.php/2011/12/22/stupidest-bar-chart-of-2011-congrats-klout/">Stupidest bar chart of the year 2011</a> and I’ve been inspired to submit my Stupidest pie chart of the year 2011. I won’t say from where I obtained it and I’ve drawn the data myself to save from annoying the original authors. And here it is (click to enlarge):</p>
<p><a href="http://chrisbeeley.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rplot01.png"><img src="http://chrisbeeley.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rplot01.png?w=300" alt="" title="Stupidest pie chart of the year, 2011"></a></p>
<p>It represents the amount of maternity and paternity leave available in different countries. Pie charts are often not a very good idea, but in this case they are the worst possible idea. Pie charts should be used when the whole pie has some meaning. A whole customer base, individuals living in Nottinghamshire, something like that. The whole of these pies represents- what? The total amount of leave in these countries. This has no real world meaning at all, and the whole point of the pie chart is lost.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>It’s that time of year again, so what do I need to keep doing or do differently this year?</p>
<p>1. Keep being organised with <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a>. I found recently that I was processing so many bits of paper and information that I just gave up. Only the most important stuff got stored in my brain, the rest was discarded. Having started using Evernote and guided by Getting Things Done I have a massive brain pack to store everything I can’t use at the moment.</p>

<p>I carried out what I thought was going to be a very simple piece of work the other day, slicing up some of the questions from a publicly available dataset in order to compare Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust with some other sites based on particular features of interest. I will post that work some other time, for now for those who are interested the source code is <a href="https://github.com/ChrisBeeley/Survey-of-mental-health-services">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I thought I would share my experience with the book which helped me through this work, which is <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L96ludyhFBsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">here</a>.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>Just a quick one from me today, lots of deadlines colliding, which is handy because that’s what this post is about. I’ve been experimenting with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)">beamer</a> class for LaTeX, with Sweave, which is another way of saying that I’ve been trying to save time producing slides for presentations directly from code as analysed by R.</p>
<p>The syntax is very simple, open a document with:</p>
<p>documentclass{beamer}<br>
usetheme{Berlin}<br>
title{Title goes here}<br>
author{Chris Beeley}<br>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I try to publish as much of my work as I can on the internet, where the people who own the data agree (my little bit of the website is <a href="http://www.institutemh.org.uk/-about-us-/our-evaluation-service">here</a>) but very often I can’t publish the data because of issues with ongoing projects, other publications, various levels of confidentiality of data, and so on.</p>
<p>So I’ve decided to try to simulate the data whenever there is an issue with publication. It’s very easy and it’s an excellent way for me to be able to show people my work without any of the issues that come from showing real data. The code is below, it comes in two parts for the first set of variables because we fiddled with the questionnaire a bit after Time 8 in the dataset.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I ran the Robin Hood marathon yesterday in a decent-ish 4 hours and 13 minutes, which is my best yet. Naturally, I was curious to see how my fellow runners fared, and so I have scraped the times from a pdf and summarised them using R and ggplot2.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>Over at <a href="http://exploringdatablog.blogspot.com/2011/08/some-additional-thoughts-on-useless.html">this</a> excellent blog there is an interesting discussion about times when means and medians can be deceptive, particularly in the case where two variables with equal means have very different distributions. I chimed in myself and mentioned some of the examples which I come across in my work. Here is a particularly egregious example, measurement of self-esteem in patients on psychiatric wards in England and Belgium-</p>
<p>England mean<br>
3.4<br>
Belgium mean<br>
3.2<br>
England median<br>
3.3<br>
Belgium median<br>
3.2<br>
England sd<br>
1.2<br>
Belgium sd<br>
