        <blockquote>
<p>The system should be cautious around imagining that it can push away the challenge of TREs – and all work with NHS data – by procuring ‘black box’ services. Building platforms, capacity and modern working methods for data is a complex technical challenge, requiring deep knowledge across a range of domains: data science, data architecture, and software development; but also clinical informatics, NHS data needs, health data research, and more. This work must be done close up with real users of data, constantly iterating to improve platforms and approaches. There is no single contract that can pass over responsibility for this work. These new and complex technical challenges around data must be met by building teams, tools, methods, working practices, code and platforms</p>

<p>I love that they did this, but that’s not why I’m writing a blog post about. What I love is the assumption that you should be able to sit at your desk with a web browser and find this stuff. That’s what “open” should mean. I’m so sick to death of being told stuff is “open source” and then I ask where it is they say “I’ll email you a copy”.</p>

NHS-R has a couple of repos looking at matters related to the review (<a href="https://github.com/nhs-r-community/statements-on-tools">statement on tools</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nhs-r-community/nhs-r_vision">NHS-R vision</a>) and we need to do some thinking about stuff that particularly comes out of this review that we can look at (which I have started <a href="https://chrisbeeley.github.io/notebook/docs/goldacre_review/nhs-r/">doing on my own</a>, community effort will follow).</p>

        <p>I think this might be a general cultural problem, but I notice it a lot in my field of healthcare analytics. There are lots of “case studies” and “pathfinders”, that kind of thing, groups of people who are doing amazing stuff.</p>
<p>I don’t think that it has the desired effect though. People look at these groups doing incredibly complicated things with new tools and they think it just doesn’t apply to them. Let the pathfinders pathfind and we’ll just churn out some rubbish in Excel, same as last week.</p>

        <p>Nobody should ever have to apologise for looking at jobs, however settled they are. Looking at jobs just means one of:</p>
<ol>
<li>there might be a better job out there and I want to find it if there is</li>
<li>I want to understand what skills people are recruiting so I can learn and do the right stuff</li>
<li>I’m interested in the jobs and skills that are popular now because I want to understand the playing field of human resources in analytics as an actual or potential leader</li>
<li>I want to understand my worth under agenda for change to I can advocate for the development of my professional role (and my salary <img src="https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/google-medium/1f609.png" alt=":wink:"> ) in my current role</li>

<p>Any manager that doesn’t like that is a fool, a charlatan, a psychopath, or all three, and then you can add:</p>

        <p>This might be a little bit controversial, this post. If you hate it please don’t be offended, it’s just my opinion. Totally open to being completely wrong always, especially here.</p>
<p>I’ve heard a lot of people talk about the importance of taking your leave, and encouraging your staff to take your leave, and I do think it’s super important to take leave, and I certainly think if you’re managing someone you should definitely encourage them to take their leave. There is more to life than work, and having your leave can even make you better at your job when you get back, so it’s win-win, you benefit and your job benefits.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>One weird thing in remote/ pandemic times is that people have started turning their cameras off when they eat. I’m all for the right to turn your camera off, I think you should be able to do that at any time without giving a reason, but I think it’s a shame if people think that they can’t eat on camera. I have therefore been glad to eat several large, difficult to eat things in meetings on camera recently, to perhaps give others the idea that it’s okay if they want to do it too.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I’ve had lively debates about dashboards with various people, including someone in my own team, and somebody on Twitter just mentioned that dashboards are often not used (this blog post will be my response to this tweet, not the first time I’ve answered a tweet with a blog and very on brand for me 😉).</p>
<p>I should acknowledge at the top that I’m The Dashboard Guy. I’ve written books about making dashboards in R. It’s my role in the data science team in which I sit. <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> in <a href="https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/presentations/tree/main/2021-04-08%20Shiny%20in%20production">production</a>.

        <p>I’ve been enjoined to make <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisBeeley/status/1458382972990763010?t=-jJDY6EMGq2UNuWlA1HKow&amp;s=19">statistics sexy</a>. It’s really taking root in my brain.There are no easy answers in statistics; it’s a long, hard road. It’s rigorous, and honest, and that’s why I love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5HnW1YP3vTk">Frank Harrell’s talk at NHS-R</a> typified this. The price of truth can be very high- like binning all the data from your £1m study instead of doing what many do which is slice it into so many pieces that something looks shiny and publishing that.</p>

I quote:</p>
<h4 id="working-in-the-open">“Working in the open</h4>
<p>Public services are built with public money, and so the code <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/service-standard/12-make-new-source-code-open">they are based on should be made available</a> for digital pioneers across the health and care system, and those working with it, to reuse and build on.</p>
