      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I’m a bit late with the report from the last day of the useR conference, I was very busy Thursday getting home and catching up with the housework on Friday. I once again favoured sessions about graphics and best in show must go to <a href="http://4dpiecharts.com/2011/08/17/user2011-easy-interactive-ggplots-talk/">Easy interactive ggplots</a>, particularly for a bit of a coding novice like myself. I’m going to take some of the ideas from this talk and use them at work, it will blow everyone’s mind (well, doing it for free with blow everyone’s mind, anyway) so a big thank you to Richie for sharing his ideas and his code.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>The last post perhaps was a bit over-long on extraneous detail and bits of R-commands that most readers will either know backwards or have no interest in, and today’s learning sheet is over double the length of yesterday’s, so let’s really do one thing I learned today.</p>
<p>One thing I learned today was about the <a href="http://www.rtexttools.com/">RTextTools</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> package which sounds like a great way of classifying textual data. I’ve already had a go with some text stuff in a <a href="http://chrisbeeleyimh.wordpress.com/2011/08/02/fun-with-wordclouds/">previous post</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> but I hadn’t really thought about the whole data mining/ machine learning thing all that seriously until today. I do wonder whether this would have applications to the patient survey (900 responses a quarter, and actually now I think of it we have about 1500 from early in its life that were never classified). There is a person who codes the responses as they come in, and I don’t need or want to take that job off him, because clearly a person is always going to be better than a machine at classifying text, but if I could prototype it then one intriguing possibility would be raised. It would enable us to change the coding system. We set the whole thing up quite quickly and I did rather think we were stuck with the coding system forever (since we don’t want to recode 6000+ rows) but if the computer can do it reasonably well then we could change it as we saw fit. We could even have different coding systems for different parts of the Trust, all sorts of things. All interesting things to muse on.</p>

        <p>Well, I said I was going to blog at least one thing I learned at the conference each day, today I’ve learned about 50 million things (yesterday was tutorials so I learned two things well; seen 20 presentations today, posters later).</p>
<p>To be honest I think this post is going to be more use to me in remembering everything than it will be to anyone else, but I’ll try to do it properly.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I’m at the <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/statsdept/user-2011/">useR! conference</a> so I’ll be blogging every day with at least one thing that I learned.</p>
<p>The first thing, which I think I half-knew and had also half-learned from bitter experience, is that all the R experts seem to use Linux, Ubuntu in the case of the two people who ran the tutorials I attended today. I already dual-boot Windows and Linux and I think over time I’m going to reduce Windows to the operating system on which I play games and check my work email (which I can only get to run on Windows due to security software requirements).</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>With a baby on the way my wife and I have become very interested in the interest rate on our mortgage, and how it might go up or down, and how that will affect whether we overpay to build up some equity, etc. etc. etc. As you will know if you’ve ever thought about your mortgage payments, it’s all quite complicated and difficult to think about.</p>
<p>For a bit of fun I thought I would produce a graph which summarises the value of the mortgage over time as well as the proportion of the money which is spent on capital and interest payments. The repayment is fixed for a given value of interest, so a stacked barchart will have a fixed height, with a different proportion of the bar coming from capital and interest payments over time.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>Took delivery of a new book today, Tufte’s Visual Display of Quantitative Information. Obviously it’s a classic but I had no idea what a beautiful book it is. Camera doesn’t do it justice:</p>

<p>Full of wonderful illustrations from throughout the ages as well.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>As always, I’m late to this party, and wordclouds have come under fire in recent times, e.g. here: <a href="http://www.drewconway.com/zia/?p=2624">drewconway.com</a>. From my point of view they’re eye-catching, and I hope that by putting them up on a website or in a report they might cause people to linger and look in more detail at other pieces of data and visualisation. That’s all I’m going to say for now, I’m sure I’ll talk again about what’s attractive to data scientists and statisticians and what’s attractive to the general public, but let’s leave it for now.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>Within my organisation we have something known as the Service User and Carer Experience Survey, often abbreviated to the SUCE, or in more natural spoken English, the patient survey. It’s a chance for the users of our services to tell us about our services and includes Likert-type “ticky box” questions about specific aspects of care as well as an open section in which they can give an area for improvement as well as something they like about the service. Results are published quarterly and reporting represents a major challenge- we report over about 100 teams, all organised into larger directorates and divisions, with each category having its own type of report. I’ve been involved right from the start and the process goes nicely from a How-Not-To-Do-It guide to a How-To guide.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>Inspired by the many excellent blogs about research, statistics, and computing I have finally decided to set up my own. My work for Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust and the Institute of Mental Health comprises advice and consultancy, research and evaluation, and data visualisation. I like to use R for my statistics, and have recently started making reproducible research using Sweave and odfWeave. Over time I have found I need to write more and more code and I am studying Java in October to help me on the way to being a proper programmer.</p>
