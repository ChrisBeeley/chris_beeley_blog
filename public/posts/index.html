      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I&rsquo;ve talked a couple of times about people using AI to apply for jobs in my team. I don&rsquo;t entirely feel like I&rsquo;ve got my point across so I thought I&rsquo;d write a blog post about it.</p>
<p>I think sometimes people think that I actively want to weed out people who need AI to help them write an application form. So I&rsquo;d like to say upfront that I do not want to weed out that kind of person. When I recruit data scientists I look for people who can communicate well, but that absolutely includes people who use AI to help them communicate well. Clearly you can use AI to communicate in the actual job, so I have no issue with people using it as part of the recruitment process. For the same reason I don&rsquo;t give people silly tests they do in 30 minutes with no google in my interviews. I ask people to bring me some code they wrote and to talk about it. Use whatever tools you want, but bring me something that&rsquo;s yours and explain it to me. And it works very well.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I think I already learned the lesson that is the subject of this blog post before but I&rsquo;m having to relearn it in my new role as a data science manager rather than a data science do-er.</p>
<p>When I first started to get into data science I made the mistake I think a lot of people make where they think &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing data science, data science is typing code, I want to do lots of data science, let&rsquo;s type a lot of code&rdquo;. And you just feverishly type code all day. Once you&rsquo;ve been doing that for a few months you start to realise that you&rsquo;re just making a huge mess. All your code needs refactoring, your dashboard is ugly and makes no sense, you&rsquo;re using a model that really just doesn&rsquo;t work with the data. You make a big pile of mess at high speed and then slowly improve it at low speed.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>OK, so I&rsquo;ve finished interviewing lots of data scientists over the last few weeks. I&rsquo;m sorry that there were so many applications for the data scientist (hundreds) that I really can&rsquo;t give people feedback to individuals whose application was not selected for interview. However, I thought what I could do is give some advice for people who were not successful in getting to interview, and quite honestly I would say the same to a lot of you anyway so I think it&rsquo;s almost as good. I&rsquo;m going to make two observations first, and then I&rsquo;ll give some advice.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>I&rsquo;m recruiting at the moment. I&rsquo;ve had quite a lot of people ask questions about the job and I thought rather than answer some questions for some people I would just answer all the questions on my blog and then point people here.</p>
<p>Before I do I will make a couple of observations about the recruitment process. Everything is done from the application form which is stripped of identifying information. We don&rsquo;t look at CVs and I don&rsquo;t take into account any previous correspondence with individuals when we&rsquo;re marking the application form. I totally understand why people might want to say a bit about themselves when they get in touch to ask questions but do remember that we won&rsquo;t remember any of it, or your CV, or any questions that you ask. We&rsquo;re not allowed to do that and quite honestly I correspond with a lot of people and so I genuinely just won&rsquo;t remember individuals. With all that said here are some questions and answers.</p>

        <p>Another one in my series of &ldquo;Wot I reckon&rdquo; posts based on no science or evidence at all, just me trying to figure stuff out. So proceed at your own risk.</p>
<p>This post is a bit more dangerous than the previous posts I wrote (for me, I mean) because it may get a little bit ranty in the middle (which I will try to avoid) but also because I don&rsquo;t think it really paints me in the best light, or certainly the old me it doesn&rsquo;t paint in a good light. And for all I know this perspective is unique to me and everyone else got it first time. If so, this is just a letter to my past self, but I can&rsquo;t see the harm in that.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>Part two in my &ldquo;Wot I did next&rdquo; series of blogs about management/ leadership in data science, and the usual caveats apply- I claim no expertise in any of the subjects therein. I&rsquo;m doing and learning stuff at the moment, and throughout most of my career I&rsquo;ve written them down on the internet for my own reference and in case they help others.</p>
<p>This one is, like the last one, about something that made me more uncomfortable the further I got into it. I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that most analysts in the NHS feel like they are not being heard, and they often feel like they don&rsquo;t have autonomy over what they learn and do. I&rsquo;ve been lucky to have been supported by line managers who&rsquo;ve given me the freedom to explore and do new things, but I know many are not. Despite the support I have received from my managers in the past (and present) I still think it&rsquo;s fair to say that analysts are not the most influential of NHS staff and are indeed sometimes marginalised and ignored.</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>This blog has existed for a long time. The first entry is nearly thirteen years old. I&rsquo;ve always been a big believer in blogging and I have met many people and learned many things from blogging. It kind of tailed off a bit as I got busier and I haven&rsquo;t really blogged at all since I got my new job in January 2023 (just one entry since then).</p>
<p>I used to blog technical stuff, bits of code and whatnot. I don&rsquo;t actually do that any more and I unconsciously thought that my blogging days are behind me. But in the last 6 months or so I&rsquo;ve got more and more interested in thinking about and describing what happens when somebody with a technical job (like my old job) gets a substantially less technical job (like my current job). Although I still talk about data science and think about data science most of the day, I never write any code any more and to be honest a decent chunk of the stuff that goes on in my team is a little beyond my grasp technically.</p>

        <p>I was on a panel the other day talking about data science careers (I guess there will be a link to it somewhere at some point, I’ll share it when I see it) and they’ve sent some questions out after the event because they didn’t get through them all.</p>
<p>I may as well answer them here where everyone can see them rather than just have the people who came read them (hmm… might be a general point about working in the open there somewhere 🤔😉). There’s quite a few so I’ll take a few goes to get through them all.</p>

        <p>I found the earliest possible reference that I ever made to RAP in a document, part of an evaluation report I submitted nearly 10 years ago. At the time I wrote it I had hoped that it would be ceased on by the people who read it as an obviously important innovation, but I can see now that change is not so easily won. Anyway, just for fun, here it is, June 25th 2012, written in Sweave before all that newfangled RMarkdown (even that’s not newfangled now! Quarto!).</p>

      <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
        <p>Building your own tools for data science is a pretty fundamental concept, and I think it’s fair to say that it’s totally alien to most NHS bosses. I shall henceforth be showing them this excellent section from the Goldacre report. It’s not about data science as such, it’s about TREs, but it illustrates the concept beautifully</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data science team at the music-streaming service Spotify do innovative work with data that helps drive the usability and popularity of their subscription service. For example, they extract patterns in the listening behaviour across all their users, and then use this to provide individual users with tailored recommendations for other music they might enjoy. The Spotify data science team couldn’t buy, off the shelf, a data science environment specifically built to service the needs of “a global music streaming service”. They implemented standard off-the-shelf tools for a general purpose data science environment. Then, within that raw environment, they needed to build their own tools, analytic approaches, workflows, data preparation work, and so on. A new arrival in the Spotify data science team today will find modules of code, libraries and packages – some even with nice interactive interfaces – to help them find interesting new patterns in Spotify user data. Many of these tools will feel like part of the furniture, but they were all built by their predecessors in the Spotify data science environment. Furthermore, many of these tools will not have been built to a pre-determined specification, by software developers hired to do that work to order; rather, they will emerge from a team. A single analyst might painstakingly implement a one-off analysis; if it looks like the approach will have broader use, then a more experienced developer might offer to help package it up into a function or library, with good documentation; if it becomes a commonly used approach, they might work with other analysts to create an interactive tool</p>
