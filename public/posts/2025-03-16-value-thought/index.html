        <p>I think I already learned the lesson that is the subject of this blog post before but I&rsquo;m having to relearn it in my new role as a data science manager rather than a data science do-er.</p>
<p>When I first started to get into data science I made the mistake I think a lot of people make where they think &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing data science, data science is typing code, I want to do lots of data science, let&rsquo;s type a lot of code&rdquo;. And you just feverishly type code all day. Once you&rsquo;ve been doing that for a few months you start to reailse that you&rsquo;re just making a huge mess. All your code needs refactoring, your dashboard is ugly and makes no sense, you&rsquo;re using a model that really just doesn&rsquo;t work with the data. You make a big pile of mess at high speed and then slowly improve it at low speed.</p>
<p>I twigged this after a while and started to realise data science is actually thinking and planning. The typing code bit comes right at the end. It&rsquo;s the last thing you do. And I would very often walk away from my keyboard and write on a piece of paper to stop me from just banging code out.</p>
<p>The other lesson that I had to learn soon after was to <strong>value</strong> this thinking time. Some days I would finish a day of data science with nothing much to show for it. A diagram and a data import. A GitHub repo containing a README and a licence. Some days I would finish with nothing at all. And when you&rsquo;re under pressure or rushing it&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of cutting this time down. It feels like an indulgence, something to be minimised when you&rsquo;re in a rush. And now you&rsquo;re back to making a big mess again but now it&rsquo;s even worse because you&rsquo;re kicking yourself about &ldquo;wasting&rdquo; the first three hours of the day thinking.</p>
<p>Anyway, I learned that lesson, and sometimes when I&rsquo;m talking to data scientists who need to learn it themselves or just need a reminder I will bring it up and tell them to value thought and planning more than coding, not less.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and I&rsquo;m a manager. I don&rsquo;t write any code, ever. Now it&rsquo;s my job to make decisions. I do this by talking to people and sending emails. Sometimes I write four sides of A4 if I want to influence lots of people to make a bigger decision. And despite already learning this lesson before, thoroughly, I fall into the same trap. The more decisions I make, the more emails I send, the more productive I am. The consequences aren&rsquo;t as bad as they are in data science doing, I don&rsquo;t think. You don&rsquo;t make a big mess you have to unpick, or not usually anyway. I think the consequences here are that you end up in a hyper local and hyper optimised situation that&rsquo;s not improving. Each decision is just optimised against the last thing you did with no purpose or direction. And eventually you wake up in completely the wrong place and think &ldquo;Oh! I wish I was over there!&rdquo; when you haven&rsquo;t moved in that direction once for six months.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve learned that lesson, with help from wiser folk at my workplace. And now I&rsquo;ve fallen into the second trap, AGAIN, even though I already learned it before and just fell into the first trap. Now I&rsquo;m once again undervaluing time thinking and planning, especially when I&rsquo;m under stress. And a day with low output feels awful. I&rsquo;m finding it even harder now because there is so much to ignore. In my old life there was a code editor, sitting with the cursor flashing, and I would ignore that and write in a notebook. Now there are five or more things and I have to ignore all of them in order to think and plan. And ignoring five things all day and still finishing with low output feels really terrible. But I&rsquo;m learning at the moment that, just as data science isn&rsquo;t typing, managing isn&rsquo;t sending emails and that the best person I can be is calm and considered and has a coherent plan based on reason and evidence, and not just a hyperactive tempest, pinging around and firing off volleys of emails to keep things on track (but I am sometimes that just as I used to sometimes sit and code for 10 hours when the situation demanded it).</p>
