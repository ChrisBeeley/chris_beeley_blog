<p>I’ve made a little video just to run through all the chapters and which code file goes with which bit of the book. While I was doing it I noticed the minimal example from chapter 2 is missing. It’s only small so I don’t think anybody will be too bothered about typing it but I’ve put it on <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChrisBeeley/8924a0bfc1fc7853e7a7b859a2a133f0">a Gist</a> anyway.</p>
<p>Hopefully that should resolve any problems with the book and the code, do let me know if not, on here or just DM me @chrisbeeley on Twitter.</p>
<p>The video is here:</p>
