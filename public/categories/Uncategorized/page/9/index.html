                </p>
                
                <div class="post-entry">

                    
                    <p>I haven‚Äôt really done much in the way of citing papers in the last couple of years, I‚Äôve spent my time either messing around with Shiny servers or databases or writing RMarkdown reports- and being horribly ill, of course, haha!- see this blog, passim. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm as fit as a flea now üôÇ</p>
<p>Anyway, I‚Äôve been citing one or two papers today and I‚Äôve found it very easy to cite both papers and R packages in RMarkdown, so I‚Äôm here to tell you not to ignore it because it‚Äôs too hard, just do it. Step one: add the bottom line of the following to your YAML header:</p>
<p>‚Äî<br>
title: ‚ÄúValidation of complexity scores in AMH‚Äù<br>
author: ‚ÄúChris Beeley‚Äù<br>
date: ‚Äú21 January 2019‚Äù<br>
output: html_document<br>
bibliography: bibliography.bib<br>
‚Äî</p>
<p>Now create a file called bibliography.bib in the same directory as the RMarkdown. You can either download the .bib off journal websites, or use a program dedicated for it (I didn‚Äôt bother, I‚Äôm just writing a few sides, not a thesis), or you can even write your own pretty easily by just looking at the template for a similar type of reference and hand editing the field. Here‚Äôs my hand edited bit for a paper that I referenced which didn‚Äôt have any snazzy download .bib on the website:</p>
<p>@Article{Butler2005,<br>
author = ‚ÄúButler, J.‚Äù,<br>
title = ‚ÄúMonitoring Community Mental Health Team Caseloads: a systematic audit of practitioner caseloads using a criterion based audit tool‚Äù,<br>
journal = ‚ÄúAdvancing Practice in Bedfordshire‚Äù,<br>
year = ‚Äú2005‚Äù,<br>
volume=‚Äù2‚Ä≥,<br>
number=‚Äù3‚Ä≥,<br>
pages=‚Äù95‚Äì105‚Ä≥<br>
}</p>
<p>You cite this in your RMarkdown using whatever identifier is on the top line, in this case I put the Butler2005 there, and in the RMarkdown you just write @Butler2005.</p>
<p>You can cite R by just typing citation() into the console and copying the .bib into your .bib file, and you can cite, say, the psych package by typing citation(‚Äúpsych‚Äù).</p>
<p>Packages will look funny when you cite them because they‚Äôre usually referred to by name, not by author, so rewrite your reference like this:</p>
<p>with assistance from the psych [-@psych2018] package.</p>
<p>The minus excludes it from the actual text while still including it in the references at the end.</p>
<p>Just press ‚Äúknit‚Äù and it will put the references in automatically, so you probably want to write</p>
<p>## References</p>
<p>above the end line or something like that.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs it! I just learned it from scratch, did it, and wrote this blog post in 10 minutes so you really have no excuse now, do you üòâ ?</p>

                    <p>I hate nested ifelse statements in R code. I absolutely hate them. They are just ugly and difficult to read. I found this lovely function in dplyr called case_when (which is like the SQL CASE WHEN if you know that) that banished them forever. It‚Äôs easier if I just show you (this is from the documentation)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;pre class=&#34;brush: r; title: ; notranslate&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;

x &lt;- 1:50
case_when(
  x %% 35 == 0 ~ &#34;fizz buzz&#34;,
  x %% 5 == 0 ~ &#34;fizz&#34;,
  x %% 7 == 0 ~ &#34;buzz&#34;,
  TRUE ~ as.character(x)

                </p>
                
                <div class="post-entry">

                    
                    <p>My exciting news is that I was accepted onto the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-science-accelerator-programme/introduction-to-the-data-science-accelerator">data science accelerator</a> and have been doing it since late December. My project, basically, is all about using natural language processing to better understand the patient experience data that we collect (and, if I have time, the staff experience data too). Here are the goals:</p>
<p>1) Using an unsupervised technique, generate a novel way of categorising the text data to give us a different perspective. We already have tagged data but I would like to interrogate the usefulness of the tags that we have used<br>
2) a. Generate a system that, given a comment or set of comments, can find other comments within the data that are semantically similar. Note that this system will need to run live on the server, since it would be impossible to store the semantic similarity of every comment to every other comment<br>
3) b. Generate a system that, instead of searching by word, searches by similarity to that word<br>
3) Produce a supervised learning algorithm which can be trained on a sample of tagged comments and then produce tags for comments that it has not previously seen<br>
4) a. Produce a sentiment analysis function that can tag every comment in a database with how positive or negative it is<br>
4) b. Produce reporting functions that can compute overall sentiment for a group of documents (e.g. of a particular service area) and optionally describe the change in sentiment over time</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not really sure if I‚Äôm going to get through all of it but I‚Äôve made a decent start. I‚Äôve made a <a href="https://trello.com/b/GlmtpsqB/data-science-accelerator">Trello board</a> and there‚Äôs a <a href="https://github.com/ChrisBeeley/naturallanguageprocessing">GitHub</a> too.</p>
<p>One of the things about the project I haven‚Äôt mentioned above is that I want to make something that can easily be picked up and used by other Trusts. There are loads of companies who want to charge money for NHS Trusts to use their black box but I‚Äôm trying to make something others can use and build on. So a lot of the work at the end will be on that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I‚Äôll share the work at the end but I‚Äôve learned loads already so I thought I‚Äôd talk about that. It‚Äôs the best thing I‚Äôve done since my PhD in terms of learning (so I recommend your doing it!) so there are lots of things I want to talk about.</p>
<p>The first one isn‚Äôt super complicated or a revelation to anyone but it‚Äôs affected the way I work already. It‚Äôs this. Ship code! Ship it! Get it out the door!</p>
<p>Up to now to be honest my agile working has pretty much been that I spend six months on something, I release it, it‚Äôs terrible, and then I make improvements. One of the product managers at GDS told me that they ship code every week. Every week! I couldn‚Äôt believe it. So I‚Äôm trying to work like that. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it isn‚Äôt perfect, doesn‚Äôt matter if some of the functionality is reduced, just get something in the hands of your users. Then if they hate it you can avoid spending a month building something they hate.</p>
<p>And, something related to that, start with a pipeline. Right at the start of an analysis, start building the outputs. This helps you to know what all this analysis is actually going to do. It helps you to make the analysis better. And it gives you code that you can ship. Build something that works and does something and give it to your users. They will start giving you feedback before you‚Äôve even finished the analysis. Too often we start with the analysis and only think about the endpoint when we‚Äôve finished. Maybe it‚Äôs the wrong analysis. Maybe what you‚Äôre doing is clever but no-one cares. Build a pipeline and get it out the door. Let your users tell you what they want.</p>
<p>More on this as the project proceeds</p>

                </p>
                
                <div class="post-entry">

                    
                    <p>So this is my annual New Year‚Äôs post, it‚Äôs an idea from David Allen that I‚Äôve done <a href="https://chrisbeeley.net/?p=1052">before</a>.</p>
<p>2018 was the year that I was finally (pretty much) better. I had my bowel and spleen removed in August 2017 and bled in quite a scary way, but by the time 2018 rolled around I was running 9 miles, building mileage ready for a marathon in May. It‚Äôs been a great year. I did have some pretty scary health problems (that I won‚Äôt go into) but it all worked out in the finish and I‚Äôm pretty much back to working and being happy with my family just as I was all the way back in 2014 before everything started to go wrong.</p>
<p>So the first big news of 2018 was I got a new job (March). I‚Äôm now half time in my old job, and half time in the new one. They both link together, in that I do Shiny code and server admin to facilitate several dashboards that we use for staff and patient experience and some clinical stuff too. I‚Äôm absolutely loving both jobs. We‚Äôre doing a lot of stuff that is pretty new in the NHS, we‚Äôre the first Trust that I‚Äôm aware of with a Shiny Pro licence, and I‚Äôve talked to people all over the country about what we‚Äôre doing. My Trust is very supportive and it‚Äôs all going really well.</p>
<p>I suppose my next big thing was running a marathon in May. It wasn‚Äôt as fast as I would have liked (four hours and thirty three minutes), but I did have quite a few pretty serious problems with being ill so I did pretty well considering. I‚Äôve got another one in 2019, more on which later. Next up was the British Transplant Games (July). It was my first time competing and I won bronze at 5K and 1500m, which was very nice. My big goal now is to qualify for the world games, I‚Äôm guessing silver would be enough to do that, partly depends on the time I guess, too.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life I have a savings account, which is absolutely great, and I‚Äôm trying (and failing) to save three times my salary by February 2019. My wife and kids are a lot happier now I‚Äôm better, we all really went through hell so it‚Äôs been a great year just doing normal stuff you can‚Äôt do when you‚Äôre ill, like go abroad.</p>
<p>And the most recent thing that‚Äôs exciting is starting the data science accelerator. I keep meaning to blog more about it, I‚Äôm overbusy just doing it, but there‚Äôs a GitHub with some of the first steps on <a href="https://github.com/ChrisBeeley/naturallanguageprocessing">here</a>. Text analysis is really easy to do, and really hard to do well, so I‚Äôm really glad that I‚Äôve got a mentor to guide me through it. I‚Äôm working really hard trying to build some robust analysis and hopefully deploy some sort of reusable pipeline that other NHS Trusts can use. I‚Äôve been dabbling in Python, too, which I really want to do more of. I feel like having other languages could help me build more and better stuff more easily. I‚Äôve really bought into the whole agile development thing, as well, that‚Äôs a part of the accelerator, and one of the talks by a product manager was fascinating.</p>
<p>So that‚Äôs it for 2018. I‚Äôm starting 2019 strong. Very strong. My health was a teensy bit wobbly this time last year but I‚Äôm as strong as an ox at the moment. It really feels good after being frightened and weak for such a long time. At work I want to tie up all the threads and be a part of an agile data science team, producing robust statistical analyses using interactive web based technologies (like Shiny!).</p>
<p>Oh yes! That reminds me. Of course last year I also wrote <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/web-application-development-r-using-shiny-third-edition">a book</a> and I started teaching statistics to Trust staff- advanced stuff in 12 one hour tutorials and a quick review in a 2 and a half hour lecture. The teaching has been going really well, I‚Äôve been getting a lot of good feedback and I‚Äôm really hoping it helps my Trust do better with the data it collects.</p>
<p>I live a blessed life. All I want to do in 2019 is keep doing the same stuff I already do and love. Run a faster marathon (sub 4 hour). Get a silver medal. Be part of a bigger, better data science team. Keep doing all the stuff we‚Äôre doing with Shiny and text analysis and help other Trusts to do it, too. And more than anything else I want my family to just live a normal life and forget about all that stuff between 2015-2017.</p>
<p>Oh yeah. And I want to solve the Rubik‚Äôs cube, too. My eldest got one for Christmas and it‚Äôs got me hooked.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs me for 2019. Good luck with whatever you‚Äôve got on your plate for the year üôÇ</p>

                    <p>This is just a quick post to show some of the stuff that I‚Äôve published/ presented/ put on GitHub recently.</p>
<p>So my Shiny book, Web Application Development with R using Shiny, 3rd edition, is out, and I‚Äôve forked the code from the publisher‚Äôs repository onto my own GitHub to make it easier to find.</p>
<p>And I‚Äôve got another book about Shiny out which is all about UI development with Shiny, and I‚Äôve forked the code from that onto my GitHub, too</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also put the talk I did about text processing at the Nottingham useR onto my GitHub as well.</p>

                    <p>Don‚Äôt judge me, but I do spend quite a lot of time making stacked barcharts of survey data. I‚Äôm trying to go full tidyverse (see this blog, passim) and there is a very neat way of doing it in the tidyverse which is very easy to expand out into functions, or purrr, or whatever. Of course, me being me I can never remember what it is so I end up reading the same SO answers over and over again.</p>
<p>So here, for all time, and mainly for my benefit, is the code to take a dataframe with the same Likert items over and over (in this case, Always/ Usually/ Sometimes/ Never) and find the proportions, change to percentages, make the x axis labels at an angle so they fit, put the stacking in the right order, and remove missing values. It‚Äôs pretty much completely generic, just give it a dataframe and the factor levels and it will work with any dataset of lots of repeated Likert items.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;pre class=&#34;brush: r; title: ; notranslate&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;

theData %&gt;% 
  gather() %&gt;% 
  group_by(key) %&gt;% 
  count(value) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(value)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(prop = prop.table(n) * 100) %&gt;%
  mutate(value = factor(value, levels = c(&#34;Always&#34;, &#34;Usually&#34;, &#34;Sometimes&#34;, &#34;Never&#34;), 
                        labels = c(&#34;Always&#34;, &#34;Usually&#34;, &#34;Sometimes&#34;, &#34;Never&#34;))) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = key, y = prop, fill = value, order = -as.numeric(prop))) + 
  geom_bar(stat = &#34;identity&#34;) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))
</code></pre><p>Et voila!</p>
