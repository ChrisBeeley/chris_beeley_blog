                </p>
                
                <div class="post-entry">

                    
                    <p>This is a book review of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/reviewproduct/1911">PHP Cookbook</a> by David Sklar, and Adam Trachtenberg.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I received this book free under O’Reilly’s Reader Review Program.</p>
<p>This is a very comprehensive book indeed. I’m relatively new to PHP programming and I used this book in two different ways. Firstly, as a straightforward cover to cover read, and secondly, as a bit of practice and to make this review a bit more realistic, to help me write a little toy application that I am developing in idle moments in the hope that I can scale it up and use it in my job.</p>
<p>As an end to end read I found it very useful indeed and it has exposed me to hundreds of PHP functions and ways of working with PHP code. There are chapters on the fundamentals (objects, variables, functions) as well as on regex, security, working with RDMSs, testing and debugging, graphics, consuming and serving APIs, and more. Although the book is clearly useful for newcomers such as myself if you are a beginner be prepared to do a bit of reading outside of the book because (rightly so) there isn’t a lot of hand-holding so if you don’t understand the syntax you may struggle to keep up.</p>
<p>I’ve been working on a project to pull text from an API and automatically format it using HTML to highlight particular words and I used this book to help me progress with that. Various chapters were useful, from the humble beginnings of reading spreadsheets and iterating over values to the chapters on APIs, XML, and processing HTML with PHP. There were useful and clear recipes for each task that I wanted to perform and, caveats about background reading on syntax notwithstanding, I was able to easily change the code and use it within my own program.</p>
<p>I received the Kindle edition of the book, I’m afraid I can’t comment on the print version, but the Kindle version is an absolute dream. There is coloured syntax highlighting, a contents page with hyperlinks to the text always available in the menu, as well as hyperlinks within the text which point not only within the book but also to documentation on the internet. Finishing a recipe and then clicking straight through to another related one, or clicking to read online PHP documentation makes working with this book an absolute joy.</p>
<p>Overall this is an excellent read, I would recommend it to newcomers and experts alike.</p>

                </p>
                
                <div class="post-entry">

                    
                    <p>A government department in Australia reports saving very large amounts of money by shunning paid for proprietary software and implementing their own version with R (<a href="http://mobile.itnews.com.au/News/390687,what-immigration-did-with-just-1m-and-open-source-software.aspx">link to story</a>).</p>
<p>If you follow the link they have some comments with a person who works at SAS who naturally talks down the benefits of free and open source software such as R (but then they would, wouldn’t they?). They report “He said the true cost of the supposedly free software can actually be quite substantial, when human resources and maintenance of the software is factored in”.</p>
<p>I’m very interested in this story, of course, because I have done this exact thing, shunned paid software and gone Do-It-Yourself using R, producing all the reports on my Trust’s <a href="http://feedback.nottinghamshirehealthcare.nhs.uk/reports">feedback website</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t know about “quite substantial”, but this approach was definitely not free and I am currently employed full time by the Trust working on the database and the front end reporting. To the best of my knowledge a commercial off the shelf (COTS) version of what we do would probably cost very roughly what they spend on me (very roughly, to within one order of magnitude, there are a lot of options and they are difficult to compare). And a COTS product would be smoother and, in particular, would have been smoother on day one: I’ve worked part time on this project for five years and the early days were rough.</p>
<p>I’m just about willing to concede that, on the face of it, a COTS version would have been cheaper and better. However, I’d like to argue here that this is not the whole story. My organisation and the public sector in general have worked with all sorts of providers of all kinds of software and I think there are two main drawbacks to this approach.</p>
<p>Firstly, the software does what it says on the tin. It does not do anything else, nor will it unless you are lucky enough to suggest it to the developers and have them accept it and begin work. There is no way for you to make the software do anything else, ever, even if you had the ability, which an organisation buying COTS products often won’t, because of course the source code is all closed. I honestly don’t think this would have worked for the feedback website which I have worked on. It’s grown in five years from a few bits of data on some scrappy spreadsheets with relatively little organisational buy-in to a colossal database comprising three very separate data sources which is scrutinised at board level monthly and which reports all over the organisation and to the general public over the internet. The change in the visibility of the project is very much to do with health policy in England and Wales and an ever increasing focus on patient experience and perhaps very particularly on the <a href="http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/">Francis enquiry</a> which emphasised the importance of listening to patients as well as being transparent about outcomes and experiences, which I’m proud to say I think my organisation does very well.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, we had no idea when we began where we were going, and I’ve been involved right from the start devising technical solutions to the myriad problems thrown up with data and reporting as the project has scaled up over time. I don’t think COTS software that we had bought three years ago would do what we want it to today and I’m not sure if COTS software exists today that does the things we want to do next. Maybe it does, I don’t know. I’m not motivated to find out, of course.</p>
<p>Secondly, and I think more importantly, organisations which buy COTS solutions don’t have any expertise inhouse about how they work, what they could be made to do, types of data that can and can’t be added, how difficult or easy different things are, or anything else. Although naturally companies often provide support contracts I feel that this is a poor substitute for having a living presence within the organisation. For myself personally, I have worked in the Trust for 12 years, as a nursing assistant, assistant psychologist, PhD student, evaluator/ analyst/ researcher, and now programmer, and I have lived and breathed the patient feedback work for 5 years. So I’m in the organisation all the time, looking for new opportunities to do the work better, getting feedback on the reporting, discussing the technical implications of adding new data sources (and advising on psychometrics, too, with my psychology PhD hat on), and a million other different things. Having knowledge of the Trust and knowledge of the technology in <em>the same person</em> is actually, in my view, a very powerful tool to ensure that the needs of service users, carers, clinicians, and managers are best implemented both in terms of the robustness of data and the information technology that will be used to gather and report on the data.</p>
<p>The Trust has supported me very well to do the things that I have done, but I’ve had to make it all up myself, I didn’t get any support or supervision with it, and my job does not really seem to fit into any of the boxes into which jobs in the NHS are put.</p>
<p>My ultimate vision would be for NHS Trusts across the country to come together to solve some of the technological problems that they are all faced with and to share these solutions with each other and, ultimately, the world (I’d make the licence non-profit, personally, but that’s just my politics, either way is fine). This is the ethos behind such projects as the wonderful <a href="http://nhshackday.com/">NHS hackday</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a hard problem, I admit, but it’s one with a glorious solution, and I certainly hope I can make a tiny contribution towards it over the next 30 years.</p>

                </p>
                
                <div class="post-entry">

                    
                    <p>This is a book review of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780814433683.do">Supercommunicator by Frank J. Pietrucha</a></p>
<p>Full disclosure: I received this book free as part of O’Reilly’s reader review program.</p>
<p>It’s a fact oft-acknowledged that books about communication and especially about grammar fall at the hurdles they themselves set, with books about grammar often containing solecisms and books about communication including leaden or otherwise dreadful prose. Even with this in mind, this is not a good book.</p>
<p>It opens badly with some very trivial advice about “knowing your audience” and not using too much multimedia, which will be news only to the worst communicators. There are several rather glaring errors, many included more than once – “pours over” when the author means “pores over”, incorrect use of “enormity” to mean “enormousness”, “reposts” instead of “ripostes”. And, perhaps most unforgivably in an age when careful writers avoid corporate-speak like the proverbial plague: “tasked with”.</p>
<p>There are many bland assertions in the mould of “Super communicators know the difference between simplicity and clarity”- again, only the worst communicators will be unaware of the distinction. Alongside statements that are well-known to any serious-minded person, there are several that are just plain wrong. The internet is “rewiring our brains”, apparently, although this is true of all human experience, and it’s quite unclear whether they are being any more “rewired” by the internet than they were by the invention of the television, radio, the printing press, or indeed the trouser press or fountain pen.</p>
<p>Chapter four ordered me to “Forget [my] 700 page tome; no one’s going to read it”. This will be news to Thomas Picketty, whose 700 page tome <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century">Capital in the Twenty-First Century</a> has been flying off the shelves worldwide. The author is unaware of any games with the power to communicate, in fact a brief study of the field of videogames would reveal more and more examples of games that communicate complex ideas very effectively, such as the critically acclaimed <a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/">Depression Quest</a> or the brilliantly understated evocation of the effect of petty bureaucracy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papers,_Please">Papers, please</a>.</p>
<p>These are all just irritations, and it is hard to take seriously a book about communication (supercommunication, even), with errors in fact and style so rampant. But the most serious flaw of the book is its failure to tackle the contradictions at the heart of being an effective communicator. Time after time we are implored to do one thing, and then the opposite, and to use our judgement within each individual context. We should use multimedia, but not too much. We should be emotive communicators, but sometimes not at all. We should just “have a go” and make our own data visualisations, or we should enlist the help of experts. In fairness to the author, making judgements like these are the hardest parts of any communicator’s job, and it is difficult to be prescriptive within a book of this type and to offer precise advice for every circumstance. However, if the book is not about these dilemmas, and cannot make any meaningful pronouncements on the subject, then it is not about anything, and not worth your time.</p>
<p>I could recommend this book only to individuals who are very poor communicators, and even then I would suggest to them that there are better examples out there (they could start by reading every word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte">Tufte</a> ever pronounced, for one, citation of Tufte within this book is one of its few saving graces).</p>
<p>And the chapters are too short. I understand the author is trying to make a point about communication but we’re not idiots and several of the chapters are quite obviously about the same thing and should have been grouped together.</p>

                    <p>I made a little Twitter ticker for work the other day, which will fetch posts with a particular hashtag and then animate them marquee style across the screen, I thought I may as well share it here. This version will fetch the last 100 tweets to the #rstats hashtag, remove the retweeets, and then show up to 50 animated across the screen.</p>
<p>All of the Twitter authentication PHP magic is stolen from <a href="http://140dev.com/twitter-api-programming-blog/twitter-api-ebook-single-user-twitter-oauth-programming/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I’m afraid the usual health warnings apply, I have no special talents in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or PHP, I am learning all three, so this code merely works- it is not necessarily the best way of doing it.</p>
<p>In the first chunk of HTML we pull in the jQuery library and include a JavaScript function.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;pre class=&#34;brush: xml; title: ; notranslate&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;


&lt;html xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&#34; xml:lang=&#34;en&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;

&lt;head&gt;

  &lt;meta name=&#34;generator&#34; content=&#34;Geany 1.23.1&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;script src=&#34;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&#34;text/javascript&#34;&gt;
</code></pre><p>The JavaScript function ensures that the animation runs at a constant speed regardless of how long the text is. Because the CSS3 animation takes a number of seconds as a parameter for how long the animation should run for, and because we have no way of knowing how long the text will be in advance, the JavaScript looks at the text at runtime and then scales the number of seconds the animation runs for by the length of the text. I then use jQuery to add it to the CSS instruction in the head of the html.</p>
<p>Much of the code is borrowed from <a href="http://www.jonathan-petitcolas.com/2013/05/06/simulate-marquee-tag-in-css-and-javascript.html">here</a>, I’ve fiddled with it slightly to make it do something slightly different.</p>
<p>The last instruction just tells the browser to reload when the animation finishes, which will restart the animation of course but also fetch new tweets.</p>

</code></pre><p>This next part is the bit that fetches the tweets using PHP. It’s pretty simple if you follow the guide I link to at the top of the post. The only difficulty I had was parsing what comes back from the API, you can convert from JSON (as below) and you will end up with loads of nested associative arrays. It’s just a case of picking your way through by using print_r().</p>
<p>As you can see in my code below most of the interesting stuff lives in $response_data[“statuses”] (or maybe it all does, I never quite got to the bottom of it to be honest) and I check to see if the array key ‘retweeted_status’ exists within that array and (if it doesn’t, i.e. it’s not a retweet) then I print $response_data[“statuses”][“user”][“name”] and $response_data[“statuses”][“text”]</p>

If I ever need to do this or get bored and decide to have a go I’ll add it to this post. There’s a demo of the feed <a href="http://chrisbeeley.net/website/twitterapidemo/rstats.php">here</a>.</p>

                <div class="post-entry">

                    
                    <p>Full disclosure: I received this ebook free under the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/reviews/">O’Reilly Reader Review Programme</a>.</p>
<p>This is a review of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023487.do">Learning PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and CSS, 2nd Edition</a> by Robin Nixon.</p>
<p>As you can tell by the title this is a big book that covers a lot of material. There is a decent treatment of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and CSS within this book. When I came to it I knew nothing about PHP, a little MySQL, a smidgen of JavaScript, and a little bit of CSS and could follow each of the sections without too much difficulty.</p>
<p>The book starts off by looking at the fundamentals of programming (loops, functions, classes etc.) using PHP. To my mind it’s doubtful that anybody who came to this book without these basic concepts would be able to follow the book throughout its entirety without having recourse to other resources- in particular, I don’t think programming with objects can be learned from such humble beginnings. There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with that, but it does make one question whether the rudiments might have been better explained at the level of an amateur (as opposed to novice) programmer just to get the material moving a bit. In my view PHP is not an obvious place to start learning to program because it is very sloppy and quirky but of course all languages have pros and cons for beginners (my first language was R, which is probably an even worse choice of first language).</p>
<p>The first couple of chapters also cover setting up a development environment (a WAMP/ MAMP/ LAMP stack, essentially), there is a slight focus on WAMP/ MAMP (by the book’s own admission) which doesn’t fit my own Linux-based prejudices but you may well be glad of it.</p>
<p>I read this book with a very specific goal in mind, to design and build a database and web frontend for a project at work and this book has been very valuable in that goal. The chapters build nicely, teaching the fundamentals of PHP and MySQL and then exploring how to integrate them, and then looking at enhancing web content using JavaScript, Ajax, and CSS. It does feel a little bit like you are just scratching the surface with CSS because it is such an enormous topic on its own and although I learned a lot of techniques I was left a little unsure as to how to put it all together.</p>
<p>The book also covers important security and login features, such as using cookies to track logged in users, the difference between GET and POST requests, and there is a commendable emphasis on how to avoid SQL/ JavaScript injection, including a couple of functions to help prevent this kind of activity.</p>
<p>The final chapter covers an entire application which uses all of the material from previous chapters (building a rudimentary social networking site) and it was very heartening as a beginner to appreciate just how much can be achieved with a comparatively small amount of code.</p>
<p>This book certainly did what it says on the tin for me and I am using PHP/ MySQL for work as a consequence of having read and used it.</p>
<p>There is one big caveat which is that although it is quite a new book, it does include some deprecated functions. How you feel about this will depend on what you are using the book for and your pre-existing familiarity with PHP/ MySQL and associated technologies. For my part I used the book to get the basic idea of the code, how it fitted together, how to communicate between PHP/ MySQL/ HTML and so on. The inclusion of a few deprecated functions, while not ideal, does not detract from the book for me and I will no doubt come back to my code and update it once I have everything working and having better skills writing and debugging this type of code. If you are quite experienced and want a reference to industry standard programming that you can blast through and put up on a production server the inclusion of deprecated code will be of more concern to you (if you’re this far on the spectrum the book is probably too simple for you anyway, but it illustrates my point about what you’re using the book for).</p>
<p>Overall I would say this book teaches the ecosystem of PHP/ MySQL/ HTML very well and if you wish to learn that ecosystem from a reasonably novice grasp of programming it will serve you well. Absolute beginners and more expert users may wish to look elsewhere.</p>
