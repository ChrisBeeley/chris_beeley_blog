And look, it‚Äôs that thing that I say all the time, that I have pinned on my Twitter profile, the thing I‚Äôve heard time and time again for a decade that everybody just stands around nodding at and nothing actually changes. I quote:</p>
<h4 id="working-in-the-open">‚ÄúWorking in the open</h4>
<p>Public services are built with public money, and so the code <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/service-standard/12-make-new-source-code-open">they are based on should be made available</a> for digital pioneers across the health and care system, and those working with it, to reuse and build on.</p>
<p>Analysts should be encouraged to think from the outset of a project about how work can be shared, or consider ‚Äòcoding in the open‚Äô for example, through use of open notebook science. This will include sharing of technical skills and domain knowledge through sites like Cross Validated and StackOverFlow, and sharing code and methodology through platforms like GitHub, will build high quality analytics throughout the system</p>
<p>Our commitments:</p>
<ul>
<li>we will begin to make all new source code that we produce or commission open and reusable and publish it under appropriate licences to encourage further innovation (such as <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a> and <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">OGLv3</a>, alongside suitable open datasets or dummy data) (end of 2021)‚Äù</li>

                    <p>I‚Äôm reading No Rules Rules, the Netflix management book. It‚Äôs really good, lots of interesting stuff in there about doing things differently and although clearly there‚Äôs a lot I can‚Äôt do in the NHS, there are lessons in there for sure.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve just read the bit about paying people top of market rate and I‚Äôm so happy because it describes loads of people who are on $250,000, crazy money, moping around and leaving because they can get a 40% pay rise somewhere else.</p>
<p>How does 40% on top of $0.25m make you any happier? It‚Äôs a nonsense. But the people I work with and recruit don‚Äôt chop and change for money. They do what they do because it‚Äôs meaningful, and because they believe in the founding principles of the NHS.</p>
<p>So although I can‚Äôt pay top of market I don‚Äôt need to, either. I just need to ask people to do useful stuff, in the open, for everyone, and to do it their way with whatever support they need. And pay them properly, of course.</p>
<p>That I can do ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
<p>That is, in fact, my jam üé∏üé∏üé∏</p>

                    <p>One phenomenon that I find very strange in the NHS (and elsewhere, probably, I‚Äôve never worked anywhere else) is the obsession people have with having tables of numbers instead of graphs. I have encountered this absolutely everywhere. People really want to know whether something is 21.4% of the whole or 19.2% of the whole and they can‚Äôt tell by looking at the beautiful graph that you‚Äôve drawn.</p>
<p>I saw an analysis today which had nine separate tables of proportions. I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say no human being can understand a thing of such complexity. Nine tables, each with three categories, 27 proportions given. You could fit the whole thing on one graph and it would be readily apparent how they compare with each other.</p>
<p>But no, people want to know is it 13% or 15%, even though in almost all cases the amount of precision far exceeds the confidence levels of the sample.</p>
<p>Your report needs to say ‚Äúcategory A is found twice as often as C, whereas A and B are similar‚Äù. Not ‚Äúcategory A is found 17.6% of the time, whereas C is found 9.2% of the time- on the other hand category B is found 19.5% of the time‚Äù. Just writing it is exhausting me, never mind trying to understand it from cold in a meeting.</p>
<p>There are of course rare exceptions to this rule, sometimes you really need to know that something is 13.5% of the whole. But you should be asking yourself more questions- how reliable is the measure? What is the sampling error associated with this estimate? Otherwise your 13.5% is 14.6% is 12.3%. And who is usually saying this, if anyone-me!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was then popularised by Strathern as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, so ordinary. What else do we all know? League tables are a bad idea too. Somewhat related to Goodhart‚Äôs law, the problem with league tables is that they often ignore nuance. &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; schools aren‚Äôt bad, they just have an intake that starts way behind. &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; surgeons aren‚Äôt bad, they just take on the more complex cases or work in a geographical location where there are more complex cases. There are ways of trying to balance out this bias, <a href="https://www.tes.com/news/revealed-top-ranked-schools-fairer-league-tables">&ldquo;value added&rdquo;</a> in the case of schools (being married to a teacher, I hear a lot about this one), and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23426886/">case mix adjustment in the case of surgeons</a>. Although these methods go some way to ironing out problems there is always the chance that an unmeasured variable is affecting the results and distorting the picture.</p>
<p>In my own area of work, patient experience data, league tables are a terrible idea because the services are all so different and they serve so many different people. Older people are, on average, more satisfied with healthcare. People who are detained under the mental health act for what can be 10 years are, unsurprisingly, often less positive about their healthcare.</p>
<p>I would like to add another law of data to the canon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more data is used as a punishment the less engaged those it punishes will be with all data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve read so many beautifully written and persuasive arguments about the power of data, all, naturally enough, written by True Believers. People who can see how data can be used to inform service delivery and planning. If I‚Äôm honest I think I live in an echo chamber, filled with analysts and technical types, all passionate about the insights data can generate. But sadly the reality outside my little bubble is that mostly people have data done &ldquo;to&rdquo; them. Every quarter a manager or public body drops out of the sky and asks them for all these numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They‚Äôre punished if the numbers are late. They‚Äôre punished if the numbers are wrong</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they‚Äôre punished if the numbers don‚Äôt show them in a good light even if everybody knows there‚Äôs a perfectly good explanation as to why the data looks like that (thinking back to value added and case mix adjustment above).</p>
<p>They get it all done, feeling harried and that the way the data is collected and scrutinised is unfair and makes their team/ department look bad, they cross their fingers and pray that it doesn‚Äôt come back with red pen on it three days later, and then they forget about it for another quarter.</p>
<p>And the really sad thing is that these people have questions that could be answered with data. Everybody makes suppositions and hypotheses all the time, it‚Äôs impossible not to, and with help and understanding they could refine their ideas and be more effective at their job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But data has crashed through their window like a rabid dog and made a mess of the place and it never occurs to them to take that same dog to the park to see if it can help them find the jacket they left there last week</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They‚Äôre just glad to close the door and lock it and forget about the whole ordeal until the next quarter.</p>
<p>I think we do need to keep promoting the value of data and analytics, and I obviously spend a decent chunk of my time either selling people that dream or (more often) fighting Python dependencies on a server to make that dream a reality.</p>
<p>But I think it‚Äôs just as important to stop beating people with data, to try to work with them to understand why their numbers look the way they do, and to try to make all processes that involve data more to do with learning and less to do with punishing people with an unfair analysis of what really goes on in their department.</p>

                    <p>We‚Äôre systematically devaluing management and leadership in the analyst space, and I encounter a lot of people who think that a day with no code written is a day wasted. I do write code, but I do a lot of other valuable stuff too. I‚Äôve written this post as someone who is very new to managing people with my personal opinion, so just like my posts on proxied SSL with Apache, there is your caveat emptor üôÇ</p>
<p>The people I manage like to get in the zone and write code. I think of it as like they‚Äôre digging a trench. They‚Äôre not getting out of the trench, they‚Äôre not sticking their head out, they‚Äôre just digging. And it‚Äôs efficient, they‚Äôre digging fast, and it‚Äôs rewarding too. They‚Äôre working on interesting problems and solving them and it feels good. My job is just to stick my head in the trench occasionally.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat are you digging there? Oh yes, I like it, nice. You know, you could use that other tool over there on that bit. And actually, have you thought about trying this other technique? Let me show you, pass me the chisel. Okay, great. Let me know if you get stuck‚Äù</p>
<p>next trench‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHey, that looks good, what is it? I like this trench, I like this bit. You know, you‚Äôre actually going the wrong way, though, you‚Äôve gone off at an angle. Come up here and I‚Äôll show you. See that trench over there? We‚Äôre trying to get there. Just jump back in and I‚Äôll help you get it pointing in the right direction‚Äù</p>
<p>next trench‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHey, this trench is taking ages, isn‚Äôt it?! We need to finish it soon, really. I think we maybe need to not finish some bits of it for now. Which are the really important bits, do you think? Okay, let‚Äôs keep this bit. This other bit, I know you love it, and I love it too. It‚Äôs really clever what you‚Äôve done. But we can‚Äôt ship on time with it. I think we need to come back to it later, or maybe just chalk it up to experience and maybe we can do it next time‚Äù</p>
<p>This is pretty basic stuff, really. It feels a bit silly to have to spell it out. The point I‚Äôm trying to make is that the people getting in the trench occasionally are helping the people in the trench <em>stay in the trench</em> and that‚Äôs good for them and good for the project. And that‚Äôs my test for all the stuff that we do. Code review. Standup. Appraisals. Hack days. Overall, is it helping them stay in the trench, digging quickly and solving problems, or is it just a silly distraction?</p>
<p>I‚Äôve never in my life had a manager who has the slightest idea what autoregression is or how to test the assumptions of OLS regression. I‚Äôm really happy now that I do manage people and that I do know what those things are, and I hope the people I manage can benefit from my understanding of what they‚Äôre doing (even if they usually know way more about it than I do- I can at least keep up if they explain it to me).</p>
<p>(if you‚Äôve read my <a href="https://chrisbeeley.net/?p=1514">previous post</a> and you‚Äôre paying attention you‚Äôll realise that I‚Äôve just contradicted myself by saying firstly that analysts should do more than just write code all day, and then said in this post that a manager‚Äôs job is to help analysts write code all day. Forgive me. In reality the people in the trench have got other people in the trench, or possibly in a neighbouring trench, and it‚Äôs their job to stick their head in that trench and help that person write code instead of needing to get out of their trench, before coming back to their own trench. Indeed, really, the trench visitor is in fact in their own trench, and someone else sticks their head in there occasionally, but the analogy gets a bit convoluted and silly at this point. I think you get the idea, even if it doesn‚Äôt translate to actual trenches within trenches within trenches)</p>
