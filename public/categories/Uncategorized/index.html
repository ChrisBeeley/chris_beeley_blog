<p>The system should be cautious around imagining that it can push away the challenge of TREs – and all work with NHS data – by procuring ‘black box’ services. Building platforms, capacity and modern working methods for data is a complex technical challenge, requiring deep knowledge across a range of domains: data science, data architecture, and software development; but also clinical informatics, NHS data needs, health data research, and more. This work must be done close up with real users of data, constantly iterating to improve platforms and approaches. There is no single contract that can pass over responsibility for this work. These new and complex technical challenges around data must be met by building teams, tools, methods, working practices, code and platforms</p>

      <p>One weird thing in remote/ pandemic times is that people have started turning their cameras off when they eat. I’m all for the right to turn your camera off, I think you should be able to do that at any time without giving a reason, but I think it’s a shame if people think that they can’t eat on camera. I have therefore been glad to eat several large, difficult to eat things in meetings on camera recently, to perhaps give others the idea that it’s okay if they want to do it too.</p>

1. Do as much as possible using SQL (joins/ munging/ calculations and analysis) so that your analysis is portable between different BI / Viz tools<br>

      <p>We’re rebuilding our patient experience dashboard at the moment, partly to incorporate some of the work that <a href="https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/positive_about_change_text_mining">we’re doing on text mining</a> and partly to connect it up to other types of information we have like staff experience and clinical outcomes. It has to be reusable because we’re using it as the basis of the text mining dashboard that we’re building for any provider trust to use with their friends and family test data. We’re trying to make everything reusable anyway partly because the different bits of the NHS should all cooperate and produce stuff together that everyone can use and partly because we’re realising that when you make code reusable the first person who can reuse it is you, 6 months later on a similar project.<br>
So we have a patient experience dashboard that we want to hook up to our other data in our own context, and we have other trusts who want to take what we produce and hook their stuff in to it. An obvious approach is to use modules in Shiny and have a data module at the heart of the operation, which can take account of the different datasets available in each context. The next level would be a “summary type” module which would bring together all of the inputs and outputs for a particular type of data- one for patient experience, one for staff experience, etc. And the bottom level would be submodules which would carry out the individual tasks- one module to produce graphical summaries, one to produce downloadable reports, etc. We would use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/golem/index.html">{golem} package</a> for all the reasons that we normally use {golem} (help with dependencies, packaging, testing, and deployment)<br>
The basic structure would look like this:</p>

Firstly, note that in Shiny 1.5 (which is not released at the time of writing) all code in the R/ directory will be sourced automatically. This is a very good idea, I’ve got loads of source(“useful_code.R”, local = TRUE) lines in some of my applications, so it gets rid of all that.</p>

I had an old version written in base R but the survey has changed so I’ve updated it to tidyverse.</p>

      <p>Following on from the last blog post, I’ve got quite a nice way of generating lots of means from a survey dataset. This one relies on the fact that I’m averaging questions that go 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, so I can look for all questions that start with “2.”, “3.”, etc.</p>

      <p>Don’t judge me, but I do spend quite a lot of time making stacked barcharts of survey data.

Of course, me being me I can never remember what it is so I end up reading the same SO answers over and over again.</p>

      <p>There must be other people out there doing this, so I’ll share this neat thing I found today. Quite often, you’ll have a dataset that has a lot of columns, only one of which will have something in it for each row. Survey Monkey, in particular, produces these kinds of sheets if you use branching logic. So if you work in one bit of the Trust, your team name will be found in one column, but if you branched elsewhere in the survey because you work somewhere else, it is in another column. Lots of columns, but each individual has only one non-missing element in each (because they only work in one place and only see that question once).</p>

      <p>Right, here goes. Let’s tell the story. I’ve been working on this for months, not because it’s particularly hard, but because I really didn’t know what I was doing. We are a health trust in the UK (NHS), and we’ve been using Shiny on a privately hosted Linode server (Ubuntu) in the cloud for a long time. You can see it <a href="http://109.74.194.173:8080/apps/SUCE/">here</a>. We’ve done this (hosted it in the wild) because none of the data is private. It’s patient experience data. We want it to be public. If anything, we want people to steal it. To be honest it’s looking a bit tatty. I was proud of it in 2012, now not so much. I’m working on a new version.</p>

        One weird trick to getting column types right with read_csv

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Using read_csv from the tidyverse is so easy that I didn’t bother to look at the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/README.html">readr documentation</a> for a long time. However, I’m glad I did, because there is, as they say in the click bait world, one weird trick to get your column types right with read_csv. read_csv (or the other delimited file reading functions like read_tsv) does a brilliant job guessing what column types things are but by default it only looks at 1000 rows. Fine for most datasets, but actually I have more than one dataset where the first 1000 rows are missing, which doesn’t help the parser at all. So do it manually and get it right. But what a pain, all that typing, right? Wrong. Just do this:</p>

      <p>So my favourite productivity guru, David Allen, he of <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a> fame, has a suggestion for a New Year review that you should carry out each year.

      <p>I seem to have a pretty severe mental block about the gather() function from dplyr so this is yet another post that to be honest is basically for me to refer to in 6 months when I forget all this stuff.

        Lazy tables with R and pander
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>One of the many things I love about R is how gloriously lazy it can help you to be. I’m writing a report at the moment and I need to make lots of tables in R Markdown. I need them to be proportions, expressed as a percentage, rounded to 0 decimal places, and I need to add (%) to each label on the table. That’s a lot of code when you’ve got 8 or 10 tables to draw, so I just made a function that does it. It takes two arguments, the variable you want tabulated, and the order in which you want the table. I need to specify the order manually because the default alphabetical ordering doesn’t work with all of the data that I want, as in the example here. Without ordering manually, the “Less than one year” category appears at the end.</p>

      <p>I’m going full <a href="http://tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> at the moment and so I’m converting my old plyr code to dplyr.

I wrote a toy example to get it right, I may as well share it with the internet in case it helps someone else. If you can’t figure out what I’m talking about with what the function does, just run the code. You’ll see what it is. Easier than explaining in words. The following two functions carry out the same task, the latter is a translation of the former.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.patientopinion.org.uk/">Patient Opinion</a> have a new API out. They are retiring the old API, so you’ll need to transfer over to the new one if you are currently using the old version, but in any case there are a number of advantages to doing so. The biggest one for me is the option to receive results in JSON (or JSONP) rather than XML (although you can still have XML if you want). The old XML output was fiddly and annoying to parse so personally I’m glad to see the back of it (you can see the horrible hacky code I wrote to parse the old version <a href="http://chrisbeeley.net/?p=487">here</a>). The JSON comes out beautifully using the built in functions from the R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html">httr</a> which I shall be using to download and process the data.</p>

        Sharing files from host machine on virtualbox
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I’ve really started getting into virtual machines recently. Firstly because I like to try different flavours of Linux and constantly reinstalling partitions is starting to get a bit of a drag, especially when it often takes ages to get the graphical desktop to work because of my silly graphics card. Secondly, and more importantly, because I’m finding if you want to do programming, or especially write about programming, you often need a “clean” system or a system set up a particular way to test things and work on multiple things at once. So the code I write for <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> is based on the newest 0.12 version. However, my server is all the way back on 0.7 for various reasons to do with browser compatibility. So this means I need a local 0.7 installation to test programs that I’m updating on the server. Or sometimes it can be important to check what the dependencies for your programs are. You may have installed something a year ago that makes everything work beautifully that you’ve long since forgotten about, and if you tell someone else to do what you’re doing it won’t work on their machine. In the Linux world technologies like <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> which package up whole environments at the operating system level and help you to <a href="https://deis.com/blog/2015/sailing-past-dependency-hell-with-docker">manage dependencies</a> (amongst other things) are starting to spring up and in the R world things like <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/">packrat</a> roll up packages into bundles in order that all package versions are the same and dependencies satisfied.</p>

      <p>I saw some wonderful tweets the other day where the author gave their former naive self some time-travelling advice from their present self about how best to get started with programming. I did intend to keep the link but sadly my filing system has failed and it’s fallen through the cracks. I’m grateful to the author, in any case, for inspiring this post, written on the fifth anniversary of my own initial foray into the world of programming. I will give myself five pieces of advice for five years, also because five is a nice round-ish number.</p>

      <p>This post is in response to a question on Twitter, but it may be of interest to others. I produced a Shiny app for querying Google Analytics data for my <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/web-application-development-r-using-shiny">book</a>. The data on the live version which lives <a href="http://chrisbeeley.net:8080/shiny/GA/">here</a> is automatically pulled in via the API each time the application is run. That code cannot live on my <a href="https://github.com/ChrisBeeley">GitHub</a> because it needs the username and password for the API. So I’m reproducing it here. It’s very simple and is based on the wonderful R package rga which can be found <a href="https://github.com/skardhamar/rga">here</a>. Obviously the XXXXXXXs have got real things in the real version, this is the redacted version.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>The new version of Shiny (0.9) is wonderful, hopefully I will talk about it again soon, but it does break the code in my book, <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/web-application-development-with-r-using-shiny/book">Web application development with R using Shiny</a>. It’s only a small difference, the selectInput() function used to ask for preselected elements to be given as the name of a list (i.e. the friendly version that appears to users in the UI, “Egg Salad”) whereas now it asks for the actual value (“eggSalad”, e.g.).</p>

However, I went to see the IT department and they have very kindly given me access to a virtual machine with Ubuntu 12.04.04 LTS running on it. It’s completely firewalled from the internet and is only visible from within the network, which is quite useful because it means I can put up things on it which are not for public consumption.</p>

      <p>When I started using R in about 2009 <a href="http://users.stat.umn.edu/~geyer/Sweave/">reproducible research</a> was a complete eye-opener for me. Statistical analyses should be reproducible both by the author of them and by the scientific community and by embedding the analysis and outputting code within a <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/lp.html">literate programming</a> framework such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweave">Sweave</a> this was possible. Nearly everything I produce now, whether for regular reports on patient experience for the NHS Trust for which I work or for scientific papers is reproducible.

I followed the instructions here <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CitrixICAClientHowTo">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CitrixICAClientHowTo</a>, got some weird error message, followed the instructions here <a href="http://forums.citrix.com/thread.jspa?threadID=306353&amp;tstart=0">http://forums.citrix.com/thread.jspa?threadID=306353&amp;tstart=0</a> and BOOM, I was in.</p>

      <p>Sort of apropos of nothing, really, this, but I was doing some research with some colleagues the other day and to help out I built a <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/">shiny</a> application in a morning. Munging the data etc. took ages as it always does but once I actually had everything clean and tidy and working laying an interface on top was the easy bit. What a fantastic tool it really is, completely changed the way we work with data now we can just throw stuff on the internet and let people play around just in the morning. My sincere thanks to all the devs at <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio.</a></p>

        Parallelising with R

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I’ve been fitting some generalised linear mixed effects models with 400,000 rows or so and it takes a while even on my quad core 3.4Ghz behemoth. The time has come for me to learn how to use multiple cores with R. The <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/doc/parallel.pdf">parallel</a> library which comes with the new-ish R 2.14 makes it pretty easy. For my purposes, all I needed to do was pop all of my calculations in a list and then call <a href="http://www.rforge.net/doc/packages/multicore/mclapply.html">mclapply</a> on them.</p>

        Fun with wordclouds

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>As always, I’m late to this party, and wordclouds have come under fire in recent times, e.g. here: <a href="http://www.drewconway.com/zia/?p=2624">drewconway.com</a>. From my point of view they’re eye-catching, and I hope that by putting them up on a website or in a report they might cause people to linger and look in more detail at other pieces of data and visualisation. That’s all I’m going to say for now, I’m sure I’ll talk again about what’s attractive to data scientists and statisticians and what’s attractive to the general public, but let’s leave it for now.</p>

        The patient survey: past, present and future
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Within my organisation we have something known as the Service User and Carer Experience Survey, often abbreviated to the SUCE, or in more natural spoken English, the patient survey. It’s a chance for the users of our services to tell us about our services and includes Likert-type “ticky box” questions about specific aspects of care as well as an open section in which they can give an area for improvement as well as something they like about the service. Results are published quarterly and reporting represents a major challenge- we report over about 100 teams, all organised into larger directorates and divisions, with each category having its own type of report. I’ve been involved right from the start and the process goes nicely from a How-Not-To-Do-It guide to a How-To guide.</p>

      <p>Inspired by the many excellent blogs about research, statistics, and computing I have finally decided to set up my own. My work for Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust and the Institute of Mental Health comprises advice and consultancy, research and evaluation, and data visualisation. I like to use R for my statistics, and have recently started making reproducible research using Sweave and odfWeave. Over time I have found I need to write more and more code and I am studying Java in October to help me on the way to being a proper programmer.</p>
