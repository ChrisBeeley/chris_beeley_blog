          <p>Building your own tools for data science is a pretty fundamental concept, and I think it‚Äôs fair to say that it‚Äôs totally alien to most NHS bosses. I shall henceforth be showing them this excellent section from the Goldacre report. It‚Äôs not about data science as such, it‚Äôs about TREs, but it illustrates the concept beautifully</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data science team at the music-streaming service Spotify do innovative work with data that helps drive the usability and popularity of their subscription service. For example, they extract patterns in the listening behaviour across all their users, and then use this to provide individual users with tailored recommendations for other music they might enjoy. The Spotify data science team couldn‚Äôt buy, off the shelf, a data science environment specifically built to service the needs of ‚Äúa global music streaming service‚Äù. They implemented standard off-the-shelf tools for a general purpose data science environment. Then, within that raw environment, they needed to build their own tools, analytic approaches, workflows, data preparation work, and so on. A new arrival in the Spotify data science team today will find modules of code, libraries and packages ‚Äì some even with nice interactive interfaces ‚Äì to help them find interesting new patterns in Spotify user data. Many of these tools will feel like part of the furniture, but they were all built by their predecessors in the Spotify data science environment. Furthermore, many of these tools will not have been built to a pre-determined specification, by software developers hired to do that work to order; rather, they will emerge from a team. A single analyst might painstakingly implement a one-off analysis; if it looks like the approach will have broader use, then a more experienced developer might offer to help package it up into a function or library, with good documentation; if it becomes a commonly used approach, they might work with other analysts to create an interactive tool</p>

<p>The system should be cautious around imagining that it can push away the challenge of TREs ‚Äì and all work with NHS data ‚Äì by procuring ‚Äòblack box‚Äô services. Building platforms, capacity and modern working methods for data is a complex technical challenge, requiring deep knowledge across a range of domains: data science, data architecture, and software development; but also clinical informatics, NHS data needs, health data research, and more. This work must be done close up with real users of data, constantly iterating to improve platforms and approaches. There is no single contract that can pass over responsibility for this work.

<p>I saw an analysis today which had nine separate tables of proportions. I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say no human being can understand a thing of such complexity. Nine tables, each with three categories, 27 proportions given. You could fit the whole thing on one graph and it would be readily apparent how they compare with each other.</p>

<p>So far, so ordinary. What else do we all know? League tables are a bad idea too. Somewhat related to Goodhart‚Äôs law, the problem with league tables is that they often ignore nuance. &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; schools aren‚Äôt bad, they just have an intake that starts way behind. &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; surgeons aren‚Äôt bad, they just take on the more complex cases or work in a geographical location where there are more complex cases. There are ways of trying to balance out this bias, <a href="https://www.tes.com/news/revealed-top-ranked-schools-fairer-league-tables">&ldquo;value added&rdquo;</a> in the case of schools (being married to a teacher, I hear a lot about this one), and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23426886/">case mix adjustment in the case of surgeons</a>. Although these methods go some way to ironing out problems there is always the chance that an unmeasured variable is affecting the results and distorting the picture.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTwo schools of thought :<br>
1. Do as much as possible using SQL (joins/ munging/ calculations and analysis) so that your analysis is portable between different BI / Viz tools<br>
2. Do the basics (e.g. joins and simple aggregates) in SQL, calcs and analysis in front end tools‚Äù</p>
<p>This is a great question, and I don‚Äôt mean to detract from its greatness when I say it is over simplistic. It‚Äôs an important question, and I have a lot to say on the subject, so much so in fact that I‚Äôm going to answer a tweet with a blog, which is very on brand for me üòÑ.When we think of data scientists and data engineers, we tend to think of data engineers providing beautifully normal and rapid data structures and data scientists wrangling them with a mix of SQL and R/ Python/ whatever. But in my experience it doesn‚Äôt really work cleanly that way, and nor should it.</p>

          <p>We‚Äôre rebuilding our patient experience dashboard at the moment, partly to incorporate some of the work that <a href="https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/positive_about_change_text_mining">we‚Äôre doing on text mining</a> and partly to connect it up to other types of information we have like staff experience and clinical outcomes. It has to be reusable because we‚Äôre using it as the basis of the text mining dashboard that we‚Äôre building for any provider trust to use with their friends and family test data. We‚Äôre trying to make everything reusable anyway partly because the different bits of the NHS should all cooperate and produce stuff together that everyone can use and partly because we‚Äôre realising that when you make code reusable the first person who can reuse it is you, 6 months later on a similar project.<br>
So we have a patient experience dashboard that we want to hook up to our other data in our own context, and we have other trusts who want to take what we produce and hook their stuff in to it. An obvious approach is to use modules in Shiny and have a data module at the heart of the operation, which can take account of the different datasets available in each context. The next level would be a ‚Äúsummary type‚Äù module which would bring together all of the inputs and outputs for a particular type of data- one for patient experience, one for staff experience, etc. And the bottom level would be submodules which would carry out the individual tasks- one module to produce graphical summaries, one to produce downloadable reports, etc. We would use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/golem/index.html">{golem} package</a> for all the reasons that we normally use {golem} (help with dependencies, packaging, testing, and deployment)<br>

<p>I really love modules and they solve a lot of problems, and I think they could be a great thing for a beginner to learn. No reason at all why beginners can‚Äôt learn them. The only caution I would give those learners is that some things can be weird or fiddly with modules. So if you‚Äôre learning at your own pace, and want to do everything really neatly and use industry standards, great, go for it. But if you want to throw up a Shiny application to impress your boss (for example) and learn by doing then you may find yourself going down some very long, dark rabbit holes trying to get the particular thing you want working.

          <p>I‚Äôve got into the habit of writing a yearly roundup blog post (see this blog, passim), based on a suggested framework by David Allen. Since this is the end of a decade I thought it would be fun to do one for the whole decade.</p>
<h3 id="physical">Physical</h3>
<p>Regular readers will know that as far as physical goes I have spent most of the decade getting progressively sicker with two different diseases, beating both, and then having complications from the liver transplant that saved me from the first one. Perhaps the pinnacle was having a colectomy/ splenectomy in September 2017, bleeding a lot and being very sick for several weeks afterwards and then running a marathon in 3 hours 44 minutes just 18 months later in February 2019. I went on to win silver in the 5K in the British Transplant Games in July of this year, but am now not currently running due to complications from my liver transplant. I‚Äôll be fine, I need to go and see the doctors next year, they‚Äôll sort me out.</p>

<p>Long time readers will know I‚Äôve had some pretty serious health problems over the years. I haven‚Äôt really talked about it much on here. To be honest I was frightened that people might be put off working with me if they thought I would be off sick a lot and I was also frightened at one point that I might actually be permanently unable to work if the liver disease wasn‚Äôt treatable. So I avoided talking about it with the wider world, although the people I directly work with know all about it (it‚Äôs hard to miss, really, when someone comes to work with end stage liver disease).</p>

My project, basically, is all about using natural language processing to better understand the patient experience data that we collect (and, if I have time, the staff experience data too). Here are the goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using an unsupervised technique, generate a novel way of categorising the text data to give us a different perspective. We already have tagged data but I would like to interrogate the usefulness of the tags that we have used
<ol>
<li>Generate a system that, given a comment or set of comments, can find other comments within the data that are semantically similar. Note that this system will need to run live on the server, since it would be impossible to store the semantic similarity of every comment to every other comment</li>
<li>Generate a system that, instead of searching by word, searches by similarity to that word</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Produce a supervised learning algorithm which can be trained on a sample of tagged comments and then produce tags for comments that it has not previously seen
<ol>
<li>Produce a sentiment analysis function that can tag every comment in a database with how positive or negative it is</li>
<li>Produce reporting functions that can compute overall sentiment for a group of documents (e.g. of a particular service area) and optionally describe the change in sentiment over time</li>

          <p>Don‚Äôt judge me, but I do spend quite a lot of time making stacked barcharts of survey data.

Quite often, you‚Äôll have a dataset that has a lot of columns, only one of which will have something in it for each row. Survey Monkey, in particular, produces these kinds of sheets if you use branching logic. So if you work in one bit of the Trust, your team name will be found in one column, but if you branched elsewhere in the survey because you work somewhere else, it is in another column. Lots of columns, but each individual has only one non-missing element in each (because they only work in one place and only see that question once).</p>

Fine for most datasets, but actually I have more than one dataset where the first 1000 rows are missing, which doesn‚Äôt help the parser at all. So do it manually and get it right.

          <p>I seem to have a pretty severe mental block about the gather() function from dplyr so this is yet another post that to be honest is basically for me to refer to in 6 months when I forget all this stuff. So I‚Äôm going to address the mental block I have very specifically and show some code; hopefully it will help someone else out there.</p>
<p>So whenever I use gather I put the whole dataframe in. Say I‚Äôve got ten variables. I whack the whole dataframe in and try to pull out just the ones I want using the select() notation at the end of the list of arguments. This DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE. You can‚Äôt do this:</p>

Atom (see my <a href="http://chrisbeeley.net/?p=1023">previous blog post</a>) has beautiful Git integration, as you‚Äôd expect since it was built by the GitHub people.

<p>I‚Äôve never quite been happy with my choice for other general editing, though.

I tended to write markdown in RStudio, which is kind of stupid, since RStudio is an awfully big hammer to crack that nut, but it does support markdown and I‚Äôm familiar with RStudio, so I was happy enough doing that. I never really found a Python IDE that I loved. As far as I can tell there isn‚Äôt really an RStudio equivalent in the Python world, something so well featured and brilliant that it‚Äôs really the only choice unless you have a very particular reason to use something else.</p>

          <p>One of the many things I love about R is how gloriously lazy it can help you to be. I‚Äôm writing a report at the moment and I need to make lots of tables in R Markdown. I need them to be proportions, expressed as a percentage, rounded to 0 decimal places, and I need to add (%) to each label on the table. That‚Äôs a lot of code when you‚Äôve got 8 or 10 tables to draw, so I just made a function that does it. It takes two arguments, the variable you want tabulated, and the order in which you want the table. I need to specify the order manually because the default alphabetical ordering doesn‚Äôt work with all of the data that I want, as in the example here. Without ordering manually, the ‚ÄúLess than one year‚Äù category appears at the end.</p>

The biggest one for me is the option to receive results in JSON (or JSONP) rather than XML (although you can still have XML if you want). The old XML output was fiddly and annoying to parse so personally I‚Äôm glad to see the back of it (you can see the horrible hacky code I wrote to parse the old version <a href="http://chrisbeeley.net/?p=487">here</a>).

        <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
          <p>I‚Äôve really started getting into virtual machines recently. Firstly because I like to try different flavours of Linux and constantly reinstalling partitions is starting to get a bit of a drag, especially when it often takes ages to get the graphical desktop to work because of my silly graphics card. Secondly, and more importantly, because I‚Äôm finding if you want to do programming, or especially write about programming, you often need a ‚Äúclean‚Äù system or a system set up a particular way to test things and work on multiple things at once. So the code I write for <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> is based on the newest 0.12 version. However, my server is all the way back on 0.7 for various reasons to do with browser compatibility. So this means I need a local 0.7 installation to test programs that I‚Äôm updating on the server. Or sometimes it can be important to check what the dependencies for your programs are. You may have installed something a year ago that makes everything work beautifully that you‚Äôve long since forgotten about, and if you tell someone else to do what you‚Äôre doing it won‚Äôt work on their machine. In the Linux world technologies like <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> which package up whole environments at the operating system level and help you to <a href="https://deis.com/blog/2015/sailing-past-dependency-hell-with-docker">manage dependencies</a> (amongst other things) are starting to spring up and in the R world things like <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/">packrat</a> roll up packages into bundles in order that all package versions are the same and dependencies satisfied.</p>

However, I went to see the IT department and they have very kindly given me access to a virtual machine with Ubuntu 12.04.04 LTS running on it. It‚Äôs completely firewalled from the internet and is only visible from within the network, which is quite useful because it means I can put up things on it which are not for public consumption.</p>

          <p>When I started using R in about 2009 <a href="http://users.stat.umn.edu/~geyer/Sweave/">reproducible research</a> was a complete eye-opener for me. Statistical analyses should be reproducible both by the author of them and by the scientific community and by embedding the analysis and outputting code within a <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/lp.html">literate programming</a> framework such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweave">Sweave</a> this was possible.

        <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
          <p>This is another post which is designed both to help me as an aide-memoire and also to help anyone else out there who wants to set up a new Linux install quickly and easily.</p>
<p>One of the many, many things I love about Linux is the way that you can just tear down your OS any time you like and start using a different one. Having said that, I must admit to having had some long weekends and evenings when my installation has gone kaput fiddling around trying to get everything working. I have now streamlined the process and can set up a new Ubuntu-based distribution in probably no more than about 45 minutes. My Linux career has only been from Ubuntu to the Ubuntu-based Mint so far, I have tried to use Fedora but sadly my ridiculously powerful NVidia graphics card left over from my (whisper it) Windoze days does not appear to play nicely at all with Fedora. Going to have a go with Fedora 20 some time, you never know your luck.</p>

          <p>Book review<br>
Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline By Cathy O‚ÄôNeil, Rachel Schutt<br>
Publisher: O‚ÄôReilly Media</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I received a free electronic copy of this book to review as part of O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs Reader Review Program</p>
<p>This book seems to be everywhere at the moment, largely, I imagine, because there‚Äôs a gaping hole in the market for such a book. Indeed, there‚Äôs a gaping hole in the market, it seems, for everything to do with data science, from books and courses to the actual people themselves. Famously, the world toiled away without even a Wikipedia entry for data science until the relatively recent past.</p>

<p>Jeremy Paxman expressed cynicism within the interview regarding the idea that all people need to be able to code, and by extension that all children need to be taught coding.

          <p>Sort of apropos of nothing, really, this, but I was doing some research with some colleagues the other day and to help out I built a <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/">shiny</a> application in a morning. Munging the data etc. took ages as it always does but once I actually had everything clean and tidy and working laying an interface on top was the easy bit. What a fantastic tool it really is, completely changed the way we work with data now we can just throw stuff on the internet and let people play around just in the morning.

          <p>Well, it finally launched today, the patient feedback website that we created as part of the <a href="http://www.institute.nhs.uk/innovation/spread_and_adoption/nhs_patient_feedback_challenge.html">Patient Feedback Challenge</a>. The evaluation section was part of a partnership with the <a href="http://www.nottinghamshirehealthcare.nhs.uk/get-involved/involvement-team/">Involvement Centre</a> of Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust and the web design agency <a href="http://numiko.com/">Numiko</a> to build a website which can help us to collect feedback data, summarise and report on it and share the actions and learning which have resulted. Go have a <a href="http://feedback.nottinghamshirehealthcare.nhs.uk/">look</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the philosophy of the feedback challenge was that the good practice should be ‚Äúspreadable‚Äù and the website is all built using free and open source technologies (Linux servers, all data and graphs processed using <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> etc.). We plan to roll it out in as many Trusts as possible and will charge a small sum for redesigns and changes to data processing which will allow us to repurpose it for different Trusts as well as supporting further development of the site.</p>

I‚Äôm a little rushed so I won‚Äôt hyperlink the references, apologies for this they are all at the bottom in plain text.</p>
<p>NHS data systems are, quite naturally, built around very strict data management systems which emphasise the security of data and ensuring accountability of data loss or misuse. This is right and proper. However, very frequently, clinicians, managers, auditors and evaluators do not need to access highly sensitive personal information. In certain cases, information can be shared freely over the internet, as with the data collected on patient experience within the Patient Feedback Challenge (survey responses, Patient Opinion stories, and specific extracts from the PALS database).</p>

        <p class="small opacity-75 post-summary">
          <p>If you work in the NHS you‚Äôll know that the ‚Äúnet promoter score‚Äù (aka the friends and family test- ‚Äúwould you recommend this service to family and friends?‚Äù) is coming to NHS services, indeed it‚Äôs hit the headlines with the coalition government promoting its use in the face of some pretty stiff opposition (e.g. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/health-experts-reject-friends-and-family-test-8440238.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>I have never been all that convinced by it, particularly the way the score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors (those who would not recommend or unlikely to) from the percentage of promoters (those who would recommend). We‚Äôve started using it in our survey and I have had a query because one area‚Äôs scores are jumping around a lot. I thought it was high time I looked at the actual scores. We don‚Äôt use a 10 point scale as many do, we use a 5 point scale, with the points being equal to ‚ÄúExtremely unlikely‚Äù, ‚ÄúUnlikely‚Äù, ‚ÄúNeither‚Äù, ‚ÄúLikely‚Äù, and ‚ÄúVery likely‚Äù. Net promoter is calculated by taking the proportion of ‚ÄúVery likely‚Äùs and subtracting the proportion of the bottom 3 categories summed.</p>

<p>Healthcare scientists will universally recognise the dominance of quantitative methodology over qualitative methodology, with the oft-qutoed hierarchy of evidence featuring such quantitative behemoths as meta-analysis and RCT at the top and qualitative methods further down, rather sniffily described as ‚ÄúCase reports‚Äù or ‚ÄúCase series‚Äù.</p>
<p>As a rather hardcore quantitative scientist myself with a great deal of good feeling towards my qualitative brethren, it was with joy and horror that I read Paul‚Äôs recent <a href="//www.patientopinion.org.uk/blog/post/2012/07/06/i-done28099t-want-to-be-data-i-want-a-conversation.aspx%E2%80%9D">piece</a> on the Patient Opinion blog ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be data, I want a conversation‚Äù, which flips the usual dominance relationship on its head and champions qualitative over quantitative methods. Paul argues that the NHS needs to ‚Äústep outside its mindset‚Äù and stop using words like ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù and ‚Äúmined‚Äù in regard to patient feedback which should be treated, first and foremost, as a conversation.</p>

<p>It represents the amount of maternity and paternity leave available in different countries. Pie charts are often not a very good idea, but in this case they are the worst possible idea. Pie charts should be used when the whole pie has some meaning. A whole customer base, individuals living in Nottinghamshire, something like that. The whole of these pies represents- what? The total amount of leave in these countries. This has no real world meaning at all, and the whole point of the pie chart is lost.</p>

          <p>The last post perhaps was a bit over-long on extraneous detail and bits of R-commands that most readers will either know backwards or have no interest in, and today‚Äôs learning sheet is over double the length of yesterday‚Äôs, so let‚Äôs really do one thing I learned today.</p>
<p>One thing I learned today was about the <a href="http://www.rtexttools.com/">RTextTools</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> package which sounds like a great way of classifying textual data. I‚Äôve already had a go with some text stuff in a <a href="http://chrisbeeleyimh.wordpress.com/2011/08/02/fun-with-wordclouds/">previous post</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> but I hadn‚Äôt really thought about the whole data mining/ machine learning thing all that seriously until today. I do wonder whether this would have applications to the patient survey (900 responses a quarter, and actually now I think of it we have about 1500 from early in its life that were never classified). There is a person who codes the responses as they come in, and I don‚Äôt need or want to take that job off him, because clearly a person is always going to be better than a machine at classifying text, but if I could prototype it then one intriguing possibility would be raised. It would enable us to change the coding system. We set the whole thing up quite quickly and I did rather think we were stuck with the coding system forever (since we don‚Äôt want to recode 6000+ rows) but if the computer can do it reasonably well then we could change it as we saw fit. We could even have different coding systems for different parts of the Trust, all sorts of things. All interesting things to muse on.</p>

          <p>With a baby on the way my wife and I have become very interested in the interest rate on our mortgage, and how it might go up or down, and how that will affect whether we overpay to build up some equity, etc. etc. etc. As you will know if you‚Äôve ever thought about your mortgage payments, it‚Äôs all quite complicated and difficult to think about.</p>
<p>For a bit of fun I thought I would produce a graph which summarises the value of the mortgage over time as well as the proportion of the money which is spent on capital and interest payments. The repayment is fixed for a given value of interest, so a stacked barchart will have a fixed height, with a different proportion of the bar coming from capital and interest payments over time.</p>

          <p>Within my organisation we have something known as the Service User and Carer Experience Survey, often abbreviated to the SUCE, or in more natural spoken English, the patient survey. It‚Äôs a chance for the users of our services to tell us about our services and includes Likert-type ‚Äúticky box‚Äù questions about specific aspects of care as well as an open section in which they can give an area for improvement as well as something they like about the service. Results are published quarterly and reporting represents a major challenge- we report over about 100 teams, all organised into larger directorates and divisions, with each category having its own type of report. I‚Äôve been involved right from the start and the process goes nicely from a How-Not-To-Do-It guide to a How-To guide.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the many excellent blogs about research, statistics, and computing I have finally decided to set up my own. My work for Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust and the Institute of Mental Health comprises advice and consultancy, research and evaluation, and data visualisation. I like to use R for my statistics, and have recently started making reproducible research using Sweave and odfWeave. Over time I have found I need to write more and more code and I am studying Java in October to help me on the way to being a proper programmer.</p>
