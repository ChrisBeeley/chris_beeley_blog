I chimed in myself and mentioned some of the examples which I come across in my work. Here is a particularly egregious example, measurement of self-esteem in patients on psychiatric wards in England and Belgium-</p>

<p>Looks pretty similar on the face of it. Let’s have a look at the actual distribution (click to enlarge).</p>
<p><a href="http://chrisbeeley.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/selfesteem.png"><img src="http://chrisbeeley.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/selfesteem.png?w=300" alt="" title="SelfEsteem"></a></p>
<p>Pretty different. Quite interesting to consider why the two are so different. It would appear on the face of it that the measure works better in Belgium, producing a nice normal distribution, and not so well in England, where many individuals are selecting the maximum response across all the items in the scale.</p>
<p>Too often, I think, we talk about non-normal distributions in terms of their median, when as you can see here, many sins can be hidden in this way. I don’t know why the self-esteem measure is behaving like this in England, but we haven’t finished with these data so look out for more on the blog as we have a more thorough look.</p>
