Don’t worry, I’m as fit as a flea now 🙂</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve been citing one or two papers today and I’ve found it very easy to cite both papers and R packages in RMarkdown, so I’m here to tell you not to ignore it because it’s too hard, just do it. Step one: add the bottom line of the following to your YAML header:</p>
<p>—<br>
title: “Validation of complexity scores in AMH”<br>
author: “Chris Beeley”<br>
date: “21 January 2019”<br>
output: html_document<br>
bibliography: bibliography.bib<br>
—</p>
<p>Now create a file called bibliography.bib in the same directory as the RMarkdown. You can either download the .bib off journal websites, or use a program dedicated for it (I didn’t bother, I’m just writing a few sides, not a thesis), or you can even write your own pretty easily by just looking at the template for a similar type of reference and hand editing the field. Here’s my hand edited bit for a paper that I referenced which didn’t have any snazzy download .bib on the website:</p>
<p>@Article{Butler2005,<br>
author = “Butler, J.”,<br>
title = “Monitoring Community Mental Health Team Caseloads: a systematic audit of practitioner caseloads using a criterion based audit tool”,<br>
journal = “Advancing Practice in Bedfordshire”,<br>
year = “2005”,<br>
volume=”2″,<br>
number=”3″,<br>
pages=”95–105″<br>
}</p>
<p>You cite this in your RMarkdown using whatever identifier is on the top line, in this case I put the Butler2005 there, and in the RMarkdown you just write @Butler2005.</p>
<p>You can cite R by just typing citation() into the console and copying the .bib into your .bib file, and you can cite, say, the psych package by typing citation(“psych”).</p>
<p>Packages will look funny when you cite them because they’re usually referred to by name, not by author, so rewrite your reference like this:</p>
<p>with assistance from the psych [-@psych2018] package.</p>
<p>The minus excludes it from the actual text while still including it in the references at the end.</p>
<p>Just press “knit” and it will put the references in automatically, so you probably want to write</p>
<p>## References</p>
<p>above the end line or something like that.</p>
<p>That’s it! I just learned it from scratch, did it, and wrote this blog post in 10 minutes so you really have no excuse now, do you 😉 ?</p>
