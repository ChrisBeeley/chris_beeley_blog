<p>So if you’re writing for publication you often want to turn p-values such as 3.7-e18 into something more like “p&lt;.0001 .0001=&quot;&quot; .001=&quot;&quot; .01=&quot;&quot; .05=&quot;&quot; .1=&quot;&quot; as=&quot;&quot; been=&quot;&quot; by=&quot;&quot; course=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; doing.=&quot;&quot; don=&quot;&quot; hand=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; href=&ldquo;<a href="http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/%22">http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/&quot;</a> i=&rdquo;&quot; if=&quot;&quot; is=&quot;&quot; it=&quot;&quot; language=&ldquo;R&rdquo; most=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; pvaluefunction=&ldquo;function(pValue)&rdquo; return=&quot;&quot; sometimes=&quot;&quot; tables=&quot;&quot; them.=&quot;&quot; this=&quot;&quot; this:=&quot;&quot; useful=&quot;&quot; using=&quot;&quot; whole=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sweave, or <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a> or something like that. If you’re not doing that you should start, but that’s a different post.&lt;/.0001&gt;</p>
<p>Or you may just be outputting tables with p-values in as plain text as I wrote about in <a href="http://chrisbeeley.net/?p=230">this</a> post.</p>
<p>Boom! You’ll save enough hours in your life to read the wonderful Don Quixote.</p>
