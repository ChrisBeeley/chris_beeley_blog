From my point of view they’re eye-catching, and I hope that by putting them up on a website or in a report they might cause people to linger and look in more detail at other pieces of data and visualisation. That’s all I’m going to say for now, I’m sure I’ll talk again about what’s attractive to data scientists and statisticians and what’s attractive to the general public, but let’s leave it for now.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Within my organisation we have something known as the Service User and Carer Experience Survey, often abbreviated to the SUCE, or in more natural spoken English, the patient survey. It’s a chance for the users of our services to tell us about our services and includes Likert-type “ticky box” questions about specific aspects of care as well as an open section in which they can give an area for improvement as well as something they like about the service. Results are published quarterly and reporting represents a major challenge- we report over about 100 teams, all organised into larger directorates and divisions, with each category having its own type of report. I’ve been involved right from the start and the process goes nicely from a How-Not-To-Do-It guide to a How-To guide.</p>

I chimed in myself and mentioned some of the examples which I come across in my work. Here is a particularly egregious example, measurement of self-esteem in patients on psychiatric wards in England and Belgium-</p>

        Misleading means and medians

      <p>Over at <a href="http://exploringdatablog.blogspot.com/2011/08/some-additional-thoughts-on-useless.html">this</a> excellent blog there is an interesting discussion about times when means and medians can be deceptive, particularly in the case where two variables with equal means have very different distributions. I chimed in myself and mentioned some of the examples which I come across in my work. Here is a particularly egregious example, measurement of self-esteem in patients on psychiatric wards in England and Belgium-</p>

      <p>As always, I’m late to this party, and wordclouds have come under fire in recent times, e.g. here: <a href="http://www.drewconway.com/zia/?p=2624">drewconway.com</a>. From my point of view they’re eye-catching, and I hope that by putting them up on a website or in a report they might cause people to linger and look in more detail at other pieces of data and visualisation.

        The patient survey: past, present and future

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Within my organisation we have something known as the Service User and Carer Experience Survey, often abbreviated to the SUCE, or in more natural spoken English, the patient survey. It’s a chance for the users of our services to tell us about our services and includes Likert-type “ticky box” questions about specific aspects of care as well as an open section in which they can give an area for improvement as well as something they like about the service. Results are published quarterly and reporting represents a major challenge- we report over about 100 teams, all organised into larger directorates and divisions, with each category having its own type of report. I’ve been involved right from the start and the process goes nicely from a How-Not-To-Do-It guide to a How-To guide.</p>
