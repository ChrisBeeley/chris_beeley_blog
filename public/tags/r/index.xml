      <title>Make your own HTML tables in R</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve avoid writing HTML tables by hand in R, reasoning that it would be far too complicated. But the problem with using packages like pander and rmarkdown, much as I love those packages, is you can’t fine tune the outputs. So if a colleague asks you to add little extra touches for a report you can’t really do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it was a nice surprise to find that it’s actually not that hard. Here’s a table with 3 columns which looks very nice with bootstrap (don’t know what the styling options are on WordPress so it just looks unformatted here)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Simulating data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I try to publish as much of my work as I can on the internet, where the people who own the data agree (my little bit of the website is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.institutemh.org.uk/-about-us-/our-evaluation-service&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) but very often I can’t publish the data because of issues with ongoing projects, other publications, various levels of confidentiality of data, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I’ve decided to try to simulate the data whenever there is an issue with publication. It’s very easy and it’s an excellent way for me to be able to show people my work without any of the issues that come from showing real data. The code is below, it comes in two parts for the first set of variables because we fiddled with the questionnaire a bit after Time 8 in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How do interest rates affect the way my mortgage is paid off?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/chris_beeley_blog/?p=46/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With a baby on the way my wife and I have become very interested in the interest rate on our mortgage, and how it might go up or down, and how that will affect whether we overpay to build up some equity, etc. etc. etc. As you will know if you’ve ever thought about your mortgage payments, it’s all quite complicated and difficult to think about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a bit of fun I thought I would produce a graph which summarises the value of the mortgage over time as well as the proportion of the money which is spent on capital and interest payments. The repayment is fixed for a given value of interest, so a stacked barchart will have a fixed height, with a different proportion of the bar coming from capital and interest payments over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
